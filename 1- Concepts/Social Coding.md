## `Definition`

**Social coding** is the idea that software development is a **collaborative and community-driven activity** rather than an isolated one. It emphasizes sharing, feedback, and collective improvement through online platforms where developers can contribute, review, and learn from each other’s code.

## `Key Ideas`

- **Collaboration at scale** → Developers work together through version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
    
- **Transparency** → Codebases, issues, and discussions are public or shared within teams, promoting accountability and learning.
    
- **Collective ownership** → Software evolves through contributions from many, reducing reliance on individual “heroes.”
    
- **Knowledge sharing** → Code reviews, pull requests, and open discussions help teams grow technically and culturally.
    
- **Community reputation** → Contributions in public repositories showcase skill and build credibility in the developer community.
    
- **Cultural shift** → Moves coding from a private task to a social process where communication and openness are core values.
