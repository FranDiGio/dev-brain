### `Definition`

**Labels** in user stories are **categorical tags** that help teams classify and organize different types of work within the **Product Backlog**.  
They make it easier to prioritize, track, and balance efforts between customer features, technical improvements, and maintenance.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Labels clarify _why_ a story exists and _what kind of value_ it delivers — business, technical, or otherwise.  
    This helps the **Product Owner** and **Scrum Team** maintain a healthy mix of innovation, stability, and debt reduction.
    
- **Common Labels:**
	- 🧩 **Feature Story** – Delivers new functionality or user-facing value.  
	    _Example: “As a customer, I want to track my order so I know when it will arrive.”_
	    
	- ✨ **Enhancement** – Improves an existing feature’s behavior, performance, or user experience.  
	    _Example: “Add search filters to the order history page.”_
	    
	- ⚙️ **Technical Debt** – Routine updates, dependency management, infrastructure upkeep or work that addresses shortcuts or suboptimal solutions made in previous sprints.
		*Example*: “Refactor data access layer to remove hardcoded queries.”
		
	    *(These stories don’t directly create visible customer value but prevent long-term slowdowns.)*  
	    
	- 🐞 **Bug / Defect** – Fixes a malfunction, regression, or issue found in testing or production. 
	    _Example: “Fix crash when uploading files larger than 100MB.”_
	    
	- 🆘 **Help Wanted** – Indicates that additional expertise or input is required.  
	    _Example: “Need UI designer feedback for dashboard layout.”_
	    
	- 🔁 **Duplicate** – Marks a story or issue that replicates another existing one.  
	    _Example: “Duplicate of issue #123 – same login bug.”_
	    
	- ❓ **Question** – Represents missing details, clarifications, or pending stakeholder input.  
	    _Example: “Should admins have access to archived orders?”_
	    
	- 🚫 **Won’t Fix** – Acknowledged but intentionally unresolved item (e.g., low impact or deprecated).  
	    _Example: “Legacy feature – will be removed in v2.0 instead of patched.”_
