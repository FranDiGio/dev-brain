### `Definition`

The **Daily Stand-Up** (also called the **Daily Scrum**) is a **short, timeboxed meeting** held every day of the sprint where the **Scrum Team synchronizes work** and plans for the next 24 hours.

It’s a **15-minute, team-focused conversation**, not a project status report.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Attendees:**
    
    - **Development Team** – Core participants who share progress and blockers.
    - **Scrum Master** – Facilitates the meeting and removes impediments afterward.
    - **Product Owner (optional)** – May listen or clarify questions but does **not** direct the discussion.
    
- **Process Overview:**
    
    1. **Fixed Time & Place** – Occurs at the same time each day for 15 minutes, ideally standing in a circle.
        
    2. **Each member answers three questions:**
        
        - What did I do yesterday?
            
        - What will I do today?
            
        - Are there any blockers or impediments?
        
    3. **Scrum Master records blockers** for follow-up after the meeting.
        
    4. **Table off-topic discussions** (“parking lot”) to maintain focus.
        
    5. **After the meeting:** interested members can discuss parked items while others return to work.
    
- **Focus:**
    
    - Not a **status meeting** for the Product Owner or management.
    - Meant for the **team to coordinate and self-organize**.
    - Developers blocked on a task can **pick up another story** until unblocked.
