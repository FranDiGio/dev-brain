### `Definition`

**Scrum Artifacts** are the **key information containers** that provide transparency into the product development process.

They exist to ensure that all stakeholders share a common understanding of **what is being built**, **what’s in progress**, and **what’s been completed**.

### `Key Ideas`

- Scrum defines **three core artifacts**:
    
    - **Product Backlog** → Everything that might be built.
        
    - **Sprint Backlog** → What the team commits to build this sprint.
        
    - **Increment** → The completed, potentially shippable work.
    
- Each artifact includes a **commitment** to reinforce transparency:
    
    - Product Backlog → _Product Goal_
        
    - Sprint Backlog → _Sprint Goal_
        
    - Increment → _Definition of Done_
    
- Artifacts promote **transparency, inspection, and adaptation** — the three pillars of Scrum.
