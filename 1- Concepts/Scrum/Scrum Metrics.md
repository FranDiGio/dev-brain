### `Definition`

**Scrum Metrics** are **quantitative indicators** used to measure progress, productivity, and predictability within Scrum teams.  
They provide transparency into how effectively a team delivers value during and across sprints.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Metrics in Scrum are not about individual performance — they exist to help the _team_ inspect and adapt.
    
- **Common Metrics:**
    
    - 📉 **Burndown Chart** – Visualizes remaining work over time within a sprint.
        
    - ⚡ **Velocity** – Measures average story points completed per sprint to gauge capacity.
        
    - 🕒 **Cycle Time / Lead Time** – Tracks how long it takes a story to move from “in progress” to “done.”
        
    - 🧩 **Sprint Goal Success Rate** – Measures how often sprint goals are fully achieved.
        
    - 🧭 **Escaped Defects** – Tracks bugs discovered after release, reflecting quality levels.
    
- **Philosophy:**  
    Scrum encourages using metrics as _conversation starters_, not scoreboards — they reveal trends, not judgments.
