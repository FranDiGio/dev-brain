### `Definition`

**Velocity** measures the **average amount of work a Scrum team completes per sprint**, typically expressed in **story points**. It reflects the team’s delivery capacity and helps forecast future work.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Calculated as:**  
    _Velocity = Total story points completed in a sprint_  
    (averaged across several sprints for predictability).
    
- **Purpose:**  
    Helps with _sprint planning_ and _release forecasting_ — predicting how many backlog items can be delivered in upcoming sprints.
    
- **Interpretation Tips:**
    
    - Use _averages_ over 3–5 sprints — a single sprint’s velocity can fluctuate.
    - Don’t compare velocity across teams — each team’s point system is unique.
    - Use velocity to plan capacity, not to judge productivity.
