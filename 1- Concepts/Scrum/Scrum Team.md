### `Definition`

The **Scrum Team**, also called the **Development Team**, is a **cross-functional, self-managing group** responsible for delivering product increments each sprint. They collectively plan, commit, and execute the work required to meet sprint goals.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Cross-Functional Composition:** Includes developers, testers, analysts, and operations — anyone needed to deliver working software.
    
- **Self-Organizing:** Members assign work to themselves and decide how to achieve sprint objectives.
    
- **Collaborative & Co-Located:** Optimal performance when team members are small in number (5–9) and can collaborate closely.
    
- **Dedicated Members:** Work full-time on one product, maintaining focus and consistency.
    
- **Short-Term Commitments:** Negotiate deliverables with the Product Owner sprint by sprint.
