### `Definition`

**Backlog Refinement** (formerly _Backlog Grooming_) is the **process of reviewing, prioritizing, and preparing items** in the Product Backlog to ensure they are clear, properly sized, and ready for future sprints.

It’s a collaborative activity led by the **Product Owner**, supported by the **Scrum Master** and optionally a few technical team members.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Attendees:**
    
    - **Product Owner (essential):** Owns prioritization and vision.
    - **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the process and ensures focus.
    - **Developers (select members):** Provide technical input or estimate effort.
    
- **Core Steps:**
    
    1. **Triage new issues** – Review new incoming items, decide whether to add, icebox, or reject them.
        
    2. **Rank by priority** – Order items based on business value, urgency, and dependencies.
        
    3. **Clarify details** – Add missing assumptions, acceptance criteria, or dependencies.
        
    4. **Estimate effort** – Optionally assign _story points_ for rough sizing before Sprint Planning.
        
    5. **Split or merge items** – Break down large Epics or vague stories into smaller, actionable ones.
        
    6. **Ensure “Sprint-ready”** – Top backlog items must be small, clear, and testable.
    
- **Artifacts involved:**
    
    - Product Backlog
    - User Stories
    - Labels and Story Points
