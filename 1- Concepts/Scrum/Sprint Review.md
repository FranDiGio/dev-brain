### `Definition`

The **Sprint Review** is a **Scrum event held at the end of each sprint** where the team **demonstrates the working product increment** to stakeholders. It’s a live, collaborative session focused on showing completed features, gathering feedback, and adapting the Product Backlog for future sprints.

This meeting marks the **end of the sprint’s development cycle** and celebrates progress while informing what comes next.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Attendees:**
    
    - **Product Owner** – Reviews completed stories, confirms which meet acceptance criteria, and moves accepted items from _Done_ → _Closed_.
    - **Development Team** – Demonstrates working features and discusses implementation details.
    - **Scrum Master** – Facilitates the meeting, ensures focus and timeboxing.
    - **Stakeholders / Customers** – Provide direct feedback, suggest improvements, and shape new stories based on what they see.
    - **Anyone interested in the demo** – Sprint Reviews are open; transparency and visibility are encouraged.
    
- **Process Overview:**
    
    1. **Demonstrate the Increment** – The team showcases what was built (“Here’s the feature, here’s what it does”).
        
    2. **Evaluate Against Acceptance Criteria** – The Product Owner decides which stories are accepted and which are not.
        
    3. **Handle Rejected Stories** –
        
        - Do **not** move rejected stories directly into the next sprint.
        - **Label and close** the old story to preserve velocity accuracy.
        - **Create a new story** with revised acceptance criteria for what’s actually needed.
        
    4. **Collect Feedback** – Stakeholders respond to what they’ve seen; the team notes potential improvements or new ideas.
        
    5. **Update the Product Backlog** – Convert relevant feedback into new or refined user stories for prioritization in future sprints.
        
    6. **Celebrate & Reflect** – Recognize team effort and reinforce progress toward the product goal.
    
- **Timing & Focus:**
    
    - Occurs **at the end of each sprint**, before the Sprint Retrospective.
    - Typically **1–2 hours** for a two-week sprint.
    - Focused on **the product and stakeholder alignment**, not team process improvement.
