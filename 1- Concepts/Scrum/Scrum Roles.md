### `Definition`

The **3 Roles of Scrum** define the **core responsibilities within a Scrum team**:  the **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **Scrum Team (Development Team)**. Together, they ensure balanced focus on **vision, process, and execution**.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Product Owner:** Represents the stakeholders, defines vision, manages the backlog, and decides release readiness.
    
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and coaches the team in Agile principles.
    
- **Scrum Team:** Cross-functional group responsible for delivering the product increment and self-organizing around sprint goals.

Each role has **clear accountability** but works collaboratively toward a shared objective — delivering high-value increments every sprint.
