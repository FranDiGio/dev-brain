### `Definition`

**Sprint Planning** is the **Scrum event** where the team determines _what_ work will be delivered and _how_ it will be accomplished during the upcoming sprint. It results in a **Sprint Backlog** — a set of user stories selected from the Product Backlog — and a clearly stated **Sprint Goal**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Attendees:**
    
    - **Product Owner** – Presents the _Sprint Goal_ and prioritizes backlog items.
    - **Scrum Master** – Facilitates and ensures adherence to Scrum principles.
    - **Development Team** – Selects and estimates stories, creating the Sprint Backlog.
    
- **Process Overview:**
    
    1. **Define the Sprint Goal** – A concise statement describing the value or capability to be delivered.
        
    2. **Select Stories** – The team pulls items from the top of the Product Backlog that align with the goal.
        
    3. **Estimate Effort** – Confirm or assign story points via _Planning Poker_ or consensus.
        
    4. **Check Velocity** – Stop adding stories once total story points meet the team’s average velocity.
        
    5. **Finalize Sprint Plan** – Each selected story must be “sprint-ready” (clear, small, testable).
    
- **Artifacts Created:**
    
    - **Sprint Backlog** – Stories committed for this sprint.
    - **Sprint Goal** – Shared focus that guides decisions throughout the sprint.
    - **Milestone / Sprint Tag** – Optional tracker used in tools like Jira or GitHub.
