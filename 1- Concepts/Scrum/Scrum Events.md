### `Definition`

**Scrum Events** are **timeboxed ceremonies** that structure and synchronize the work of a Scrum team. They enable transparency, inspection, and adaptation — the three pillars of Scrum’s empirical process.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Provide a regular rhythm that allows the team to plan, collaborate, inspect progress, and improve continuously.
    
- **Core Events (defined by the Scrum Guide):**
    
    1. **Sprint** – The main development cycle (typically 1–4 weeks) that delivers a usable increment.
        
    2. **Sprint Planning** – The team commits to a Sprint Goal and selects backlog items to complete.
        
    3. **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)** – 15-minute check-in for the team to align and identify blockers.
        
    4. **Sprint Review** – Demonstrate the completed increment to stakeholders and gather feedback.
        
    5. **Sprint Retrospective** – Reflect on process improvements for the next sprint.
    
- **Complementary Activity:**
    
    - **Backlog Refinement (Grooming):**  
        A non-official but essential ongoing activity to clarify, estimate, and prioritize backlog items.
