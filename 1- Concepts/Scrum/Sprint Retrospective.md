### `Definition`

The **Sprint Retrospective** is the **final event of the Scrum cycle**, held after the Sprint Review.  
Its purpose is to **reflect on the past sprint**, **evaluate team health**, and **identify concrete improvements** for the next sprint.

It focuses not on the product, but on **how the team works together** — promoting continuous improvement and a healthy, transparent culture.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Attendees:**
    
    - **Scrum Master** – Facilitates the meeting, ensures psychological safety, and documents actionable improvements.
        
    - **Development Team** – Core participants who discuss experiences, issues, and ideas openly.
        
    - **Product Owner (optional)** – May attend only if the team feels comfortable sharing feedback in their presence.
    
- **Environment:**
    
    - Safe and private — team members must feel free to speak honestly without fear of judgment.
    - Focused on improvement, not blame.
    
- **Process Overview:**
    
    1. **Reflect on the Sprint** – Review what happened during the last sprint, including team dynamics and workflow.
        
    2. **Answer the Three Core Questions:**
        
        - ✅ What went well? (What should we continue doing?)
            
        - ❌ What didn’t go well? (What should we stop doing?)
            
        - 🔄 What should we change or improve for next time?
        
    3. **Identify Actionable Changes** – The Scrum Master records improvement items and ensures at least one is implemented in the next sprint.
        
    4. **Reinforce Continuous Improvement** – The goal is to make small, consistent changes each sprint to enhance performance and morale.
    
- **Timing & Focus:**
    
    - Occurs **after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning**.
    - Usually **45–90 minutes** for a two-week sprint.
    - Focuses on **team health, communication, and process improvement** — not product features.
