### `Definition`

**Constants** are named bindings whose **associated value cannot be changed after initialization**. They represent fixed values in a program, providing safety, clarity, and intent by preventing accidental modification.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Immutability of Binding**  
    Once a constant is assigned a value, that binding cannot be reassigned.
    
- **Named Values**  
    Constants use identifiers to give meaningful names to fixed values.
    
- **Semantic Clarity**  
    Communicate intent that a value is not meant to change.
    
- **Language-Specific Rules**  
    Different languages enforce constants differently (compile-time vs runtime).
    
- **Distinction from Immutable Objects**  
    A constant may reference a value that is itself mutable, depending on the language.
    
- **Safety Mechanism**  
    Helps prevent bugs caused by unintended reassignment.
