## `Definition`

**Actionable Metrics** are **meaningful, outcome-focused measurements** that provide insight into how effectively a system or team is performing — and guide specific improvements.  
Unlike vanity metrics (which look impressive but don’t drive change), actionable metrics reflect the _health and efficiency_ of software delivery.

## `Key Ideas`

- **Actionable vs. Vanity Metrics** →
    
    - _Vanity metrics_ (e.g., page views, downloads) describe activity but lack context or causality.
        
    - _Actionable metrics_ reveal _cause and effect_ — something the team can act on to improve performance.
        
- **DevOps Key Metrics (DORA Metrics):**
    
    - **Lead Time for Changes** → Time from code committed to code running in production.
        
    - **Deployment Frequency** → How often new changes are deployed.
        
    - **Change Failure Rate** → Percentage of deployments that cause production issues.
        
    - **MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)** → How quickly the system recovers from a failure.
    
- **Purpose-driven measurement** → The goal of metrics isn’t tracking, it’s learning — helping teams iterate, reduce risk, and improve quality.
    
- **Alignment with business goals** → Metrics should connect to outcomes that deliver customer value, not internal vanity.
