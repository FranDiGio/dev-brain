### `Definition`

**Taylorism**, or **Scientific Management**, is a management philosophy developed by _Frederick Winslow Taylor_ in the early 20th century. It emphasizes **efficiency through specialization**, dividing work into distinct roles and optimizing each for speed and predictability.

While effective for factory production, this model treats people like interchangeable components — making it poorly suited to creative, iterative fields like software development.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Specialization and silos** → Workers focus narrowly on one task to maximize output. This creates efficiency but also rigid handoffs and limited collaboration.
    
- **Separation of thinking and doing** → Management plans; workers execute. In software, this mindset leads to disconnected teams and slow feedback loops.
    
- **Optimization over adaptability** → Assumes stable, repeatable work — unlike software, which evolves constantly.
    
- **Misapplied to software engineering** → Software isn’t built once and handed off like a bridge; it’s **maintained, extended, and improved** continuously.
    
- **Modern takeaway** → Treat software as a **product**, not a one-time project — it lives, grows, and requires ongoing collaboration across disciplines.
