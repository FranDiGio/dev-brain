### `Definition`

**DevOps Culture** is a shared mindset that unites **development** and **operations** teams around a common goal: delivering software quickly, reliably, and continuously.

It replaces traditional silos — where devs focus on innovation and ops on stability — with **shared ownership, collaboration, and accountability** throughout the entire delivery lifecycle.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Shared ownership** → Everyone is responsible for the product’s success and reliability — no more “dev’s fault” vs “ops’ fault.”
    
- **Common goals and metrics** → Teams align around delivery speed, quality, and user satisfaction rather than separate departmental KPIs.
	
- **Small, autonomous teams** → (ideally 5–7 engineers, never more than 10) maximize communication flow and accountability.
	
- **Long-term product or domain ownership** → gives teams a sense of purpose and continuity, increasing quality and motivation.
    
- **Collaboration over control** → Removes barriers like ticket queues and rigid handoffs that slow innovation.
    
- **Small, safe changes** → Encourages iterative delivery instead of massive, risky deployments.
    
- **Cultural shift first** → Tools (like CI/CD or cloud automation) support DevOps, but lasting success comes from trust, transparency, and communication.
    
- **Mindset contrast** → Traditional enterprises see change as risky and slow; DevOps treats change as continuous, expected, and manageable.
