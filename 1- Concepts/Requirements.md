### `Definition`

**Requirements** describe **what a software system should do**, **why** it should do it, and **under what conditions** it should operate. They define the **scope, functionality, and constraints** of a system before design or development begins.  

In the SDLC, requirements are the **core output of the Planning phase** and form the foundation for all subsequent design, coding, and testing work.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose**
	Requirements translate **business needs** into **technical direction** — ensuring that the solution built aligns with stakeholder goals and user expectations.
	
- **The Requirements Gathering Process**
	The process of defining and confirming software requirements typically follows **six iterative steps**:
	
	1. **Identify Stakeholders**  
	    Determine who is affected by or will use the system (end-users, decision-makers, admins, etc.).
	    
	2. **Establish Goals and Objectives**
	    - **Goals:** Broad, long-term outcomes the software should achieve.
	    - **Objectives:** Specific, measurable steps that fulfill those goals.
	    
	3. **Elicit Requirements**  
	    Collect information through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation to capture what stakeholders need.
	    
	4. **Document Requirements**  
	    Organize and describe findings in clear, consistent language. Early drafts often take the form of **prototypes** or preliminary documents like the SRS.
	    
	5. **Analyze and Confirm**  
	    Review the requirements for **clarity**, **feasibility**, and **alignment with business goals**. Get stakeholder approval to confirm accuracy.
	    
	6. **Prioritize Requirements**  
	    Rank each requirement as **Must-Have**, **Highly Desired**, or **Nice-to-Have**, ensuring the team focuses on what delivers the highest value first.
	
- **Types of Requirements**
	
	- **Functional:** What the system does (features, workflows).
	- **External Interface:** How it interacts with users, hardware, or other systems.
	- **System Features:** Specific internal functions or modules.
	- **Non-Functional:** Constraints like performance, security, scalability, and quality standards.
	
-  **Resulting Documents**
	
	- **URS** – Captures end-user expectations.
	- **SRS** – Defines what the software must do.
	- **SysRS** – Describes the entire system, including hardware and policies.
