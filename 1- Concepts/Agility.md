## `Definition`

Agility is the ability of a development team or organization to **adapt quickly and effectively to change**—whether in requirements, priorities, technologies, or customer needs—while still delivering working software that provides value.

---
## `Key Ideas`

- **Responding to change over following a rigid plan**: (core value from the Agile Manifesto).
	
- **Iterative and incremental delivery**: breaking work into small chunks that can be tested and refined.
	
- **Customer collaboration**: involving stakeholders throughout the process to ensure what’s built is valuable.
	
- **Cross-functional teams**: developers, testers, designers, and business roles working closely.
	
- **Continuous improvement**: regular reflection (e.g., retrospectives) to refine processes.
	
- **Working software as the primary measure of progress**.
