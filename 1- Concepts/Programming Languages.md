### `Definition`

A **programming language** is a **formal system of syntax and semantics** used to communicate instructions to a computer. It allows developers to express algorithms, logic, and data manipulation in a structured, human-readable way that can be executed by machines.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Syntax and Semantics:**  
    The **syntax** defines the rules for valid code (structure), while **semantics** defines what that code means (behavior).
    
- **High-Level vs. Low-Level:**
    
    - **Low-level languages** (like Assembly, C) are close to machine code, offering fine control over memory and performance.
        
    - **High-level languages** (like Python, JavaScript) abstract hardware details for readability and faster development.
    
- **Compiled vs. Interpreted:**
    
    - **Compiled languages** (C++, Go) are translated into machine code before execution.
    - **Interpreted languages** (Python, JavaScript) are executed line by line at runtime.
    - Some (like Java) use hybrid models (compile to bytecode, then run on a virtual machine).
    
- **Paradigms:**  
    Languages follow different programming **paradigms** — mindsets or structures for solving problems:
    
    - **Procedural:** Step-by-step instructions (C, Pascal)
    - **Object-Oriented:** Models real-world entities as objects (Java, C++)
    - **Functional:** Focuses on immutability and pure functions (Haskell, Lisp, JavaScript with FP)
    - **Declarative:** Describes _what_ to do, not _how_ (SQL, HTML)
    
- **Typing Systems:**
    
    - **Static typing** (Java, C#) catches errors at compile time.
    - **Dynamic typing** (Python, JavaScript) checks types at runtime.
