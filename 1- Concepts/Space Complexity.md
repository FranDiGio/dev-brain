### `Definition`

**Space complexity** describes how an algorithm’s **memory usage grows** as the size of its input increases. It accounts for all additional space required during execution, beyond the input itself.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Memory Growth Focus**  
    Measures how much extra memory an algorithm requires as input size grows.
    
- **Includes Auxiliary Space**  
    Counts temporary data structures, recursion stacks, and helper variables.
    
- **Input Space vs Auxiliary Space**
    
    - _Input space_: memory needed to store the input
    - _Auxiliary space_: extra memory used during execution
    
- **Expressed Using Big-O**  
    Typically described with Big-O notation to show upper bounds.
    
- **Trade-Off with Time**  
    Faster algorithms may consume more memory, and vice versa.
    
- **Critical for Constrained Systems**  
    Especially important in embedded systems and memory-limited environments.
