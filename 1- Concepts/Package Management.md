### `Definition`

**Package Management** refers to the general system that automates retrieving, installing, configuring, updating, and removing software components.  
It exists in two major domains:

- **OS-level package management** (system software)
- **Language-level package management** (project dependencies)

This concept describes the _idea_, not the specific tools.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Automated Software Delivery**  
    Ensures consistent installation and upgrades of software components.
    
- **Dependency Resolution**  
    Handles packages that depend on other packages, preventing conflicts.
    
- **Version Control**  
    Maintains consistent versions for stability and reproducibility.
    
- **Registries & Repositories**  
    Central sources for retrieving packages (OS repos, language registries).
    
- **Two Distinct Contexts**
    
    - OS packages → system-level programs, apps, drivers
    - Language packages → code libraries used within a project
