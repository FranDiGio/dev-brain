### `Definition`

A conceptual model describing how software components are retrieved, installed, updated, configured, and removed in a controlled and repeatable way. It governs how systems and projects manage external software dependencies over time.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Software is distributed as **packages** identified by names and versions
    
- Packages are retrieved from **repositories or registries**
    
- Dependency relationships between packages must be resolved
    
- Installation occurs into a defined target environment (system or project)
    
- Package management applies at multiple layers:
    
    - Operating system level (system software)
    - Language or project level (application dependencies)
    
- The concept defines **what must be managed**, not how a specific tool does it
