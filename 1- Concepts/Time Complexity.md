### `Definition`

**Time complexity** describes how the **number of operations an algorithm performs grows** as the size of its input increases. It provides a way to reason about an algorithm’s **efficiency and scalability**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Growth Over Input Size**  
    Time complexity focuses on how runtime changes as input size (`n`) grows.
    
- **Abstracted Measurement**  
    Measured in terms of operations, not actual clock time.
    
- **Expressed Using Big-O**  
    Commonly described using Big-O notation to represent upper bounds.
    
- **Best, Average, and Worst Case**  
    Algorithms can behave differently depending on input, but worst-case is often emphasized.
    
- **Independent of Implementation**  
    Hardware speed and programming language are abstracted away.
    
- **Used for Comparison**  
    Helps choose between algorithms based on expected performance at scale.
