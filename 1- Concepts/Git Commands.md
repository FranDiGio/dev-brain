### `Definition`

**Git commands** are command-line instructions used to interact with a Git repository. They allow developers to initialize repositories, track changes, manage branches, inspect history, and integrate work across branches.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Interface to Git:**  
    Git commands are the primary way developers interact with the Git version control system, especially via the CLI.
    
- **Support the Git Lifecycle:**  
    Commands map directly to stages of version control:
    
    - repository setup
    - staging changes
    - committing snapshots
    - branching and merging
    - inspecting history and status
    
- **Workflow Enablers:**  
    Commands like `git branch`, `git checkout`, and `git merge` enable parallel development and controlled integration.
    
- **State Awareness:**  
    Commands such as `git status` and `git log` help developers understand the current state and history of a project.
    
- **CLI vs UI:**  
    While many platforms provide graphical interfaces, Git commands offer precision, speed, and full control.
    
- **Often Combined with Shell Commands:**  
    Basic system commands (`mkdir`, `cd`) are commonly used alongside Git commands to manage project structure.
