### `Definition`

**Pair programming** is a collaborative development practice where **two programmers work together at one workstation**, sharing a single codebase in real time. 

One writes the code (the _Driver_) while the other reviews and guides (the _Navigator_), switching roles regularly to improve code quality and knowledge sharing.

### `Key Ideas`

Pair programming is one of the core practices of **Extreme Programming (XP)** and a powerful method for improving both code and collaboration.

- The **Driver** focuses on implementing code — typing, managing syntax, and solving immediate problems.
    
- The **Navigator** watches from a higher level — reviewing logic, anticipating issues, suggesting improvements, and thinking ahead strategically.

They switch roles frequently to balance workload and ensure shared understanding.

This technique improves **code quality**, **team communication**, and **collective ownership**. It’s especially effective in complex or high-stakes sections of code, onboarding new developers, or teaching unfamiliar technologies.

Pair programming also contributes to **social coding** and **DevOps culture** by breaking isolation, encouraging openness, and creating a shared sense of responsibility.

### `Challenges`

- Can be **inefficient** if pairs aren’t balanced in skill or communication style.
	
- **Fatigue** or conflict can arise if sessions go too long without breaks.
	
- May feel **slower** at first — but the long-term quality gains often outweigh the initial time cost.
