### `Definition`

**Software Documentation** is the collection of written, visual, or multimedia materials that **describe a software product and its development process**.  
It communicates what the software does, how it’s built, and how to use or maintain it — serving both **technical teams** and **end users**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Documentation ensures clarity, continuity, and quality across the entire **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.
    
    It enables collaboration between engineers, testers, users, and stakeholders by making requirements, design decisions, and procedures explicit.
    
- **Formats:**
    
    - **Written:** Text documents, wikis, or reports.
        
    - **Video:** Tutorials or demos.
        
    - **Graphical:** Diagrams, flowcharts, UI mockups.
    
- **Categories:**
    
    - **Product Documentation** – Explains how the software functions, its architecture, and how users interact with it.
        
    - **Process Documentation** – Describes how to execute specific workflows, maintain quality, and follow organizational standards.
    
- **Product Documentation Types:**
    
    - **Requirements Documentation (URS / SRS / SysRS)** – Defines what needs to be built.
        
    - **Design Documentation** – Explains how requirements are implemented.
        
    - **Technical Documentation** – Describes code behavior, architecture, and APIs.
        
    - **Quality Assurance Documentation** – Covers testing strategy, results, and metrics.
        
    - **User Documentation** – Guides end-users on installation, configuration, and troubleshooting.
    
- **Process Documentation Types:**
    
    - **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** – Step-by-step instructions for organization-specific processes such as code reviews, deployments, or merges.
    
- **Maintenance:**  
    Documentation must evolve with the software.
    Updates often occur during the **maintenance phase** of the SDLC to reflect UI changes, new features, or revised workflows.
