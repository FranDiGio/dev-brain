### `Definition`

**Expressions** are combinations of values, variables, and operators that **evaluate to a result**.  
**Operators** are symbols or keywords that define **operations performed on one or more operands**, such as arithmetic, comparison, or logical operations.

Together, they form the **basic building blocks of computation** in programming languages.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Evaluation to a Value**  
    Every expression produces a value (or result) when evaluated.
    
- **Operands and Operators**  
    Operators act on operands, which can be literals, variables, or other expressions.
    
- **Operator Categories**  
    Common classes include:
    
    - Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
        
    - Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`)
        
    - Logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
        
    - Assignment (`=`, `+=`)
        
    - Bitwise (`&`, `|`, `^`)
    
- **Operator Precedence & Associativity**  
    Rules determine the order in which operations are evaluated within an expression.
    
- **Composability**  
    Expressions can be nested to build more complex logic.
    
- **Language Semantics**  
    Each programming language defines its own operators, precedence rules, and evaluation behavior.
