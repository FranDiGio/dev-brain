### `Definition`

**Branching** is a **control structure** that allows a program to make decisions and execute different code paths based on conditions.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Enables **conditional execution** — running specific blocks of code only when certain criteria are met.
    
- **Common Constructs:**
    
    - `if`
    - `if-then-else`
    - `switch` / `case`
    - `GoTo` (legacy / rarely used)
    
- **How It Works:**  
    Each branch is evaluated using Boolean expressions.  
    The program follows the branch whose condition evaluates to **True**.
    
- **Example:**
```python 
if temperature > 30:
	print("It's hot")
else:
	print("It's cool")
```
**Importance:**  
    Forms the backbone of decision-making logic in any program.
