### `Definition`

**Data types** define the **kind of values** a program can work with and the **operations that are valid** on those values. They establish meaning, constraints, and expectations for how data is represented and manipulated in a program.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Classification of Values**  
    Data types categorize values such as numbers, text, booleans, or structured data.
    
- **Defines Allowed Operations**  
    The type determines what can be done with a value (e.g., arithmetic on numbers, concatenation on strings).
    
- **Representation Abstraction**  
    Data types abstract away how values are stored in memory, focusing on behavior and intent.
    
- **Static vs Dynamic Typing**
    
    - _Static typing_: types are checked before execution
    - _Dynamic typing_: types are determined at runtime
    
- **Primitive vs Composite Types**
    
    - Primitive: basic values (integers, floats, booleans)
    - Composite: collections or structures built from other types (arrays, objects, records)
    
- **Type Safety**  
    Types help prevent invalid operations and logical errors in programs.
    
- **Language-Defined Semantics**  
    Each programming language defines its own type system and rules for type conversion.
