### `Definition`

Memory & references describe how a program stores data and how variables point to that data. Memory is where values live, and references are the addresses that allow the program to locate and interact with those values.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Memory stores all program data (values, objects, arrays, stack frames).
    
- References point to where a value lives instead of containing the value itself.
    
- Variables hold either literal values or references to memory locations.
    
- Multiple variables can reference the same value in memory.
