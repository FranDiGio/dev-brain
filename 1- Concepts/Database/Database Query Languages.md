### `Definition`

**Database Query Languages** are formal languages used to define, retrieve, and manipulate data within a database. They provide a structured way to express operations on data according to a specific database model.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Formal Syntax**  
    Query languages define precise rules for expressing data operations.
    
- **Declarative Nature**  
    Many query languages are declarative, meaning users specify _what_ data they want rather than _how_ to retrieve it.
    
- **Model-Dependent Design**  
    Query languages are shaped by the underlying database model (e.g., relational, document, graph).
    
- **Abstraction Layer**  
    They abstract away internal execution details such as storage layout, indexing, or optimization strategies.
    
- **Separation from Implementation**  
    A query language defines how users interact with data, not how the database engine executes those requests.
