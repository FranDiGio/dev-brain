### `Definition`

The **Graph Model** is a database model that represents data as nodes and relationships, where connections between entities are treated as first-class elements. It is designed to model and traverse complex, interconnected data structures efficiently.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Nodes (Entities)**  
    Represent individual data objects.
    
- **Edges (Relationships)**  
    Explicit connections between nodes, often labeled and directed.
    
- **Properties**  
    Both nodes and relationships can contain attributes.
    
- **Relationship-Centric Design**  
    Connections are stored directly rather than inferred through joins.
    
- **Traversal-Oriented Queries**  
    Optimized for exploring paths and patterns across interconnected data.
	
- **Multiple Competing Query Languages**  
    Several graph query languages exist (e.g., Cypher, Gremlin, SPARQL), each tied to different ecosystems.
    
- **Pattern-Matching Orientation**  
    Graph query languages are designed around relationship traversal rather than tabular operations.
