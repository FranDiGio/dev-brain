### `Definition`

The **Relational Model** is a database model that represents data as structured tables composed of rows and columns. It organizes information into relations and defines how data entities are connected using keys and constraints.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Tables as Relations**  
    Data is stored in tables (relations), where each row represents a record and each column represents an attribute.
    
- **Primary Keys**  
    Each table includes a unique identifier to distinguish records.
    
- **Foreign Keys & Relationships**  
    Tables are connected through key references, allowing structured relationships between entities.
    
- **Declarative Querying**  
    Data is manipulated using high-level, declarative operations (e.g., relational algebra concepts).
    
- **Integrity Constraints**  
    Rules such as uniqueness, referential integrity, and domain constraints enforce data correctness.
    
- **Set-Based Logic**  
    Operations are performed on sets of rows rather than individual records procedurally.
