### `Definition`

**Database models** define the logical structure used to organize, represent, and relate data within a database. They determine how data is structured conceptually, independent of any specific software implementation or engine.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Logical Data Organization**  
    A model defines how data entities are structured and how relationships between them are represented.
    
- **Constraint Framework**  
    Each model establishes rules for how data can relate, ensuring consistency within its structure.
    
- **Query Implications**  
    The chosen model influences how data is accessed and manipulated conceptually.
    
- **Abstraction Layer**  
    Models describe how data _should be represented_, not how it is physically stored.
    
- **Different Problem Fit**  
    Certain models are better suited for structured tabular data, hierarchical documents, graph relationships, or wide analytical datasets.
