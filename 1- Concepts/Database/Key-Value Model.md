### `Definition`

The **Key-Value Model** is a database model that stores data as pairs consisting of a unique key and an associated value. Each key acts as an identifier used to retrieve its corresponding value directly, without predefined structure.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Key as Unique Identifier**  
    Every piece of data is accessed through a unique key.
    
- **Opaque Values**  
    The value can contain any type of data, but the database does not enforce or interpret its internal structure.
    
- **Direct Lookup Model**  
    Retrieval is typically performed by exact key match rather than complex queries.
    
- **High Simplicity & Performance**  
    Optimized for fast reads and writes with minimal relational overhead.
    
- **Minimal Schema Constraints**  
    There is no enforced relational structure between entries.
