### `Definition`

The **staging environment** is a pre-production environment that closely mirrors production. It is used to validate the final system before it goes live.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Production-Like Setup:**  
    Same infrastructure, configurations, and dependencies as production.
    
- **Final Verification:**  
    Used for smoke tests, release validation, and stakeholder approval.
    
- **Limited Changes:**  
    Only release-ready code is deployed.
    
- **Data Handling:**  
    Uses sanitized or copied production data where possible.
    
- **Release Gate:**  
    Acts as the final checkpoint before production deployment.
