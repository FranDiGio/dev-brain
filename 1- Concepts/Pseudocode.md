### `Definition`

**Pseudocode** is an **informal, human-readable description of an algorithm** written in a structured but language-agnostic way. It outlines a program’s logic and flow without focusing on syntax or implementation details.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Serves as a bridge between **problem-solving and coding**, helping developers focus on logic before syntax.
    
- **Characteristics:**
    
    - Written using natural language and programming-like keywords.
    - Ignores specific language syntax rules.
    - Focuses on _what_ the program does rather than _how_ it does it.
	
- **Advantages:**
    
    - Easy for **non-programmers** and programmers to understand.
    - **Faster iteration** during planning and debugging.
    - **Language-independent**, so logic can be implemented in any language later.
    - Easier to **revise and maintain** than detailed code.
    
- **Use Cases:**
    
    - Drafting algorithms before coding.
    - Explaining program logic in documentation or academic settings.
    - Facilitating collaboration across teams using different programming languages.
