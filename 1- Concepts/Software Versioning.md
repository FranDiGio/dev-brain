### `Definition`

**Software versioning** is the process of assigning unique identifiers — called **version numbers** — to different releases of a software product.  It helps track the software’s evolution, communicate the scale of changes, and manage compatibility between versions.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Enables developers and users to distinguish between **major releases**, **minor updates**, **patches**, and **builds**.  
    Facilitates maintenance, troubleshooting, and compatibility tracking.
    
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**  
    A common format that uses **three or four numbers**, separated by periods:  
    **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD**
    
    - **MAJOR:** Breaking changes or complete redesigns (e.g., 2.0 → 3.0).
        
    - **MINOR:** New features that remain backward compatible (e.g., 2.1 → 2.2).
        
    - **PATCH:** Bug fixes or small adjustments (e.g., 2.2.0 → 2.2.1).
        
    - **BUILD (optional):** Internal or less significant modifications.
    
- **Alternative Systems:**  
    Some developers use **date-based** versioning (e.g., _Ubuntu 18.04.2 → released April 2018_), or other internal numbering schemes depending on project needs.
    
- **Pre-Release Versions:**  
    Software in testing may use numbers **below 1.0** (e.g., _0.9 beta_) to indicate instability or early development stages.
    
- **Backward Compatibility:**  
    Not all software versions work seamlessly across releases.
    
    - **Backward compatible:** Newer versions can run older files or systems.
    - **Incompatible:** Major updates may break old functionality, requiring migration or updates.
