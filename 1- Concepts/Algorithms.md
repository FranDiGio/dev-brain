### `Definition`

An **algorithm** is a **finite, well-defined sequence of steps** designed to solve a problem or perform a computation. It describes _what_ needs to be done to achieve a result, independent of programming language, hardware, or execution environment.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Problem-Solving Blueprint**  
    Algorithms provide a clear procedure for transforming inputs into outputs.
    
- **Language-Agnostic**  
    The same algorithm can be implemented in different languages or systems.
    
- **Deterministic or Non-Deterministic**  
    Some algorithms always produce the same output for a given input, while others involve randomness.
    
- **Efficiency Matters**  
    Algorithms are often compared using time and space complexity rather than implementation details.
    
- **Input–Output Relationship**  
    Defined by the expected inputs, processing steps, and outputs.
    
- **Foundation of Computation**  
    All software ultimately relies on algorithms to perform meaningful work.
