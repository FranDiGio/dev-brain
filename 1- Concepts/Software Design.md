### `Definition`

**Software Design** is the **process of transforming requirements into a structured blueprint** for how a software system will function and interact. It defines the **architecture, components, interfaces, and data flow** necessary to meet functional and non-functional requirements.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    To plan _how_ a system will be built before coding begins — ensuring clarity, maintainability, and scalability.  
    It bridges the gap between **requirements analysis** and **implementation**.
    
- **Levels of Design:**
    
    - **High-Level Design (HLD):** Defines the system architecture — modules, data flow, interfaces, and technology stack.
        
    - **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Specifies internal logic, algorithms, data structures, and component interactions.
    
- **Core Principles:**
    
    - **Modularity:** Breaking the system into manageable, independent components.
        
    - **Abstraction:** Hiding unnecessary implementation details while exposing essential functionality.
        
    - **Encapsulation:** Grouping related data and behavior together for clarity and reusability.
        
    - **Separation of Concerns:** Each component handles a single, well-defined responsibility.
        
    - **Design Patterns:** Reusable solutions for common architectural or behavioral problems (e.g., MVC, Singleton, Observer).
    
- **Artifacts Produced:**
    
    - **Design Diagrams** (UML, ERD, architecture diagrams)
        
    - **Pseudocode and Flowcharts**
        
    - **Design Documentation** describing structure and interactions
    
- **Importance:**  
    A solid design reduces **bugs**, improves **team collaboration**, and makes future **maintenance and scaling** far easier.
