### `Definition`

**High-level programming languages** use **human-readable syntax** and **abstract away hardware details** to make development faster, easier, and less error-prone. They allow developers to focus on solving business problems rather than managing hardware directly.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Abstraction:**  
    Each instruction in a high-level language represents **multiple low-level machine instructions**.  
    Memory management, registers, and hardware specifics are handled automatically by compilers or interpreters.
    
- **Portability:**  
    High-level code is generally **platform-independent** — it can run on different systems through compilers, interpreters, or virtual machines.
    
- **Ease of Use:**  
    They use **natural language constructs** (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`) and provide rich libraries for faster development.
    
- **Examples:**  
    Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, C#, Swift, Kotlin.
