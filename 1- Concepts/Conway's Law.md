### `Definition`

**Conway’s Law** states that an organization’s software architecture **will mirror its communication structure**.  In practice, if teams are siloed by function **(e.g., UI, business logic, database)**, the resulting system will reflect those boundaries — often as tightly-coupled layers.  

Cross-functional, domain-aligned teams naturally produce more modular, loosely coupled architectures.

### `Key Ideas`

- Structure teams around *business capabilities*, not technical layers. 
	
- Promotes ownership, autonomy, and faster delivery.
	
- Underpins modern DevOps and microservice culture.
	
- Teams should have end-to-end responsibility for what they build.
