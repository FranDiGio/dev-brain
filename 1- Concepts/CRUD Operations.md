### `Definition`

**CRUD Operations** represent the four basic actions used to manage data in software systems: **Create, Read, Update, Delete**.  
They form the foundation for how applications store, retrieve, modify, and remove information.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Create:**  
    Adds new data to a system (e.g., INSERT in SQL, POST in REST APIs).
    
- **Read:**  
    Retrieves existing data without modifying it (e.g., SELECT in SQL, GET in REST APIs).
    
- **Update:**  
    Modifies existing data (e.g., UPDATE in SQL, PUT/PATCH in REST APIs).
    
- **Delete:**  
    Removes data from the system permanently or marks it as inactive (e.g., DELETE in SQL).
    
- **Universally Applicable:**  
    Appears across databases, services, file storage, ORMs, and application logic.
    
- **Basis for API Design:**  
    Many API endpoints and backend service patterns map directly to CRUD.
