### `Definition`

An **object** is a conceptual unit that **combines state and behavior** into a single entity. It represents an instance of a class (or prototype) and models a real-world or logical concept within a program.

### `Key Ideas`

- **State + Behavior**  
    An object encapsulates data (state) together with the functions that operate on that data (behavior).
    
- **Instance of a Blueprint**  
    Objects are created from a class or prototype definition that specifies their structure and capabilities.
    
- **Encapsulation**  
    Internal state is accessed and modified through defined behaviors, not directly.
    
- **Identity**  
    Each object is a distinct entity, even if it shares the same structure and values as another object.
    
- **Interaction Through Messages**  
    Objects interact by invoking each other’s methods.
    
- **Foundation of OOP**  
    Objects are the primary building blocks used to model systems in object-oriented programming.
