### `Definition`

Kernel responsibilities refer to the **core functions performed by an operating system kernel** to manage hardware, processes, memory, and communication between software and devices. These responsibilities form the foundation of all operating system behavior and enable applications to run safely and efficiently.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Process & Thread Management:**  
    Creates, schedules, and terminates processes; handles context switching; enforces isolation.
    
- **Memory Management:**  
    Allocates memory, manages virtual memory and paging, enforces protection boundaries.
    
- **System Call Interface:**  
    Provides the bridge between user-space programs and privileged kernel operations.
    
- **Device & Driver Management:**  
    Interacts with hardware through drivers; manages I/O, interrupts, and device communication.
    
- **Filesystem Access:**  
    Coordinates file reads/writes, permissions, mounting, and storage abstractions.
    
- **Hardware Abstraction:**  
    Shields applications from hardware complexity through standardized interfaces.
    
- **Security & Protection:**  
    Manages permissions, user identities, access control, and resource isolation.
    
- **Resource Allocation:**  
    Assigns CPU time, memory regions, I/O bandwidth, and other limited system resources.
    
- **Interprocess Communication (IPC):**  
    Provides safe mechanisms for processes to communicate (pipes, message queues, shared memory).
