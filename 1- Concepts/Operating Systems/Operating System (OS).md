### `Definition`

An **Operating System (OS)** is foundational system software that manages hardware resources and provides core services that allow applications to run. It acts as the bridge between programs and the computer’s hardware, ensuring safety, efficiency, and controlled execution.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Hardware Abstraction:**  
    Shields applications from hardware complexity by offering unified APIs and interfaces.
    
- **Kernel as the Core:**  
    The kernel handles process scheduling, memory management, device control, and system security.
    
- **Process Management:**  
    Creates, schedules, and terminates processes while ensuring isolation between them.
    
- **Memory Management:**  
    Allocates and protects memory through mechanisms like virtual memory and paging.
    
- **File System Control:**  
    Provides structured storage, permissions, and access control for persistent data.
    
- **Device & Driver Integration:**  
    Uses drivers to operate hardware components consistently and safely.
    
- **Security Model:**  
    Enforces user accounts, permissions, and controlled access to system resources.
    
- **User Space vs Kernel Space:**  
    Separates privileged operations (kernel mode) from application code (user mode) to maintain system stability.
