### `Definition`

**macOS shells** are **Unix-based command-line interpreters** used to interact with the macOS operating system, built on a BSD-derived Unix foundation.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Unix-Based Shell Environment**  
    macOS inherits its shell environment from BSD Unix, making it largely POSIX-compliant.
    
- **Commonly Encountered Shells**
    
    - **`zsh`** — default user shell since macOS Catalina
        
    - **`bash`** — available but shipped in an older version
    
- **Developer-Oriented Defaults**  
    The default shell (`zsh`) emphasizes interactive productivity while retaining Unix compatibility.
    
- **Shell Choice Does Not Affect the OS Core**  
    Switching shells only changes the user interface, not the underlying system behavior.
