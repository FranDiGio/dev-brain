### `Key Ideas`

- **Multiple Shells Are First-Class Citizens**  
    Linux is designed to support many shells concurrently, allowing users and system components to choose the most appropriate one.
    
- **Commonly Encountered Shells**
    
    - **`bash`** — default on most distributions and the de facto standard
        
    - **`sh`** — POSIX baseline, used for system scripts
        
    - **`zsh`** — popular interactive shell for developers
        
    - **`fish`** — user-friendly, non-POSIX interactive shell
    
- **System is Interactive Usage**  
    System scripts typically rely on `sh` or `bash`, while users often select `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish` for daily work.
    
- **POSIX as a Foundation**  
    Most Linux shells are POSIX-compliant or POSIX-compatible, enabling portable scripting across Unix-like systems.
