### `Definition`

The **development environment** is where developers write, modify, and experiment with code. It is optimized for rapid iteration and debugging rather than stability or performance.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Local or Shared:**  
    Can be a local machine or a shared dev server.
    
- **Fast Feedback:**  
    Hot reloads, verbose logging, mocks, and debug tools are common.
    
- **Non-Production Data:**  
    Uses test databases, fake credentials, and sample data.
    
- **Frequent Changes:**  
    Code is unstable by design and changes continuously.
    
- **Low Risk:**  
    Failures are expected and safe.
