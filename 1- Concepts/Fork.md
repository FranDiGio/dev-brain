### `Definition`

A **fork** is an independent copy of a repository created under a different owner. It allows someone to experiment or contribute to a project without affecting the original repository directly.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Independent Repository:**  
    The fork becomes a separate repository with its own branches and commits.
    
- **Different Ownership:**  
    Typically created when the original repository is owned by another person or organization.
    
- **Common in Open Source:**  
    Enables external contributors to propose changes safely.
    
- **Upstream Relationship:**  
    Forks can track the original repository to pull in updates.
    
- **Supports Contribution via Pull Requests:**  
    Changes from a fork are usually proposed back through a pull request.
    
- **Platform-Supported Concept:**  
    While built on VCS fundamentals, forks are commonly implemented by hosting platforms.
