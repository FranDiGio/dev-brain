### `Definition`

Different **deployment and pricing models** offered by cloud providers for running virtual machines. They define how compute resources are **allocated, billed, and managed** depending on the workload’s needs and stability.

### `Key Ideas`

- These types represent **strategies of provisioning VMs** in the cloud rather than specific technologies.
    
- Each model balances **cost, reliability, and flexibility** differently.
    
- Common categories include:
    
    - **On-Demand Instances** – pay-as-you-go, full flexibility.
        
    - **Reserved Instances** – long-term commitment, reduced price.
        
    - **Spot / Preemptible Instances** – low cost, can be interrupted anytime.
        
    - **Dedicated Hosts / Instances** – exclusive physical hardware for compliance or licensing needs.
        
    - **Shared / Multi-Tenant Instances** – default, cost-effective shared infrastructure.
    
- These options exist across most providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) with different naming but the same underlying concept.
