### `Definition`

**Programming Logic** is the **foundation of how software makes decisions and performs tasks**. It involves structuring instructions in a way that allows a program to **evaluate conditions**, **repeat operations**, and **produce outcomes** based on defined rules.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    To provide a structured, rule-based flow that enables a computer to solve problems using **conditions**, **variables**, and **control structures**.
    
- **Core Components:**
    
    - **Variables:** Containers for data whose values may change during execution.
        
    - **Boolean Expressions:** Statements that evaluate to **True** or **False**, forming the basis of all decision-making.
        
    - **Control Flow:** Mechanisms to direct program flow — primarily **Branching** and **Looping**.
    
- **Types of Logic:**
    
    - **Branching:** Determines _what to do_ next based on conditions.
        
    - **Looping:** Determines _how many times_ to repeat a set of instructions.
    
- **Importance:**  
    Understanding programming logic is essential to writing **efficient**, **readable**, and **error-free** code.  
    It underpins every programming paradigm — from procedural to object-oriented.
