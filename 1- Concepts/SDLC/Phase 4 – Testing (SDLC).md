### `Definition`

**Phase 4 – Testing** is the stage of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the software is thoroughly evaluated to ensure it meets all defined **requirements**, functions correctly, and is free of major defects before deployment.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Validates both the **functionality** and **quality** of the software product. The goal is not just to find bugs but to confirm that the system behaves as expected under different conditions.
    
- **Test Case Creation:**  
    Based on the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**, testers design structured cases that define specific inputs, execution steps, and expected outcomes.
    
- **Execution & Bug Tracking:**  
    Test cases are executed manually or through automated frameworks. Detected issues are logged, prioritized, fixed, and retested until the software is stable.
    
- **Testing Levels:**
    
    - **Unit Testing:** Checks isolated code modules.
    - **Integration Testing:** Ensures combined modules work together correctly.
    - **System Testing:** Validates the complete, integrated product.
    - **Acceptance Testing:** Confirms readiness for release and user satisfaction.
    
- **Testing Types:**
    
    - **Functional:** Validates specific behaviors and features.
    - **Non-Functional:** Tests performance, security, scalability, and usability.
    - **Regression:** Ensures updates or fixes haven’t broken existing features.
    
- **Outcome:**  
    Produces a validated, high-quality product ready for deployment, along with testing documentation and reports for traceability.
