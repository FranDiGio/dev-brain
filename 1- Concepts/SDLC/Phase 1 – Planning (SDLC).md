### `Definition`

The **Planning Phase** is the **first stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, focused on defining the **project’s objectives, scope, feasibility, and requirements**. 

It transforms an abstract business problem into a **clear development plan** — outlining _what_ needs to be built, _why_, _for whom_, and _how_ success will be measured.

### `Key Ideas`

-  **Purpose**
	- Establish the **foundation** for all later SDLC phases.
	- Align stakeholders, goals, and resources before design and development begin.
	- Identify **risks, constraints, and dependencies** early to prevent rework or scope creep.
	
- **Core Activities**
	
	1. **Requirements Gathering**
	    - Define what the system must achieve, who will use it, and how success is measured.
	    - Output: Requirements, which leads to artifacts like **SRS**, **URS**, and **SysRS**.
	    
	2. **Feasibility Analysis**
	    - Evaluate technical, operational, legal, and financial feasibility.
	    - Helps determine whether the project is worth pursuing.
	    
	3. **Resource and Effort Estimation**
	    - Estimate time, cost, and personnel required.
	    - Identify key roles, responsibilities, and timelines.
	    
	4. **Risk Identification and Mitigation**
	    - Predict possible project challenges or technical blockers.
	    - Document potential mitigations and backup strategies.
	    
	5. **Project Planning and Scheduling**
	    - Define milestones, deliverables, and success criteria.
	    - Establish communication protocols and reporting methods.
	
-  **Outputs of the Planning Phase**
	- **Feasibility Report** – Summarizes findings from initial analysis.
	- **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** – Defines the project’s technical goals.
	- **Project Plan or Roadmap** – Outlines milestones, budget, and timeline.
