### `Definition`

**SDLC** is a structured framework that defines the **stages of software creation** — from planning and design to testing, deployment, and maintenance. It provides a **standardized approach** to ensure software is developed efficiently, predictably, and with consistent quality.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Lifecycle Phases:**  
    Typical stages include **Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance**.  
    These phases ensure teams move logically from concept to delivery.
    
- **Purpose:**  
    Establishes **clarity, accountability, and repeatability** in software projects.  
    Enables coordination among developers, testers, managers, and stakeholders.
    
- **Models (Implementations):**
    
    - **Waterfall** – Sequential and plan-driven.
        
    - **Agile** – Iterative and adaptive.
        
    - **Spiral** – Risk-driven and cyclic.
        
    - **DevOps** – Continuous delivery and integration-oriented.
    
- **Relation to Software Engineering:**  
    SDLC is a **core concept within Software Engineering**, defining _how engineering practices are applied_ throughout a project.
