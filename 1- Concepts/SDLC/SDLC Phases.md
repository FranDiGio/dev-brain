### `Definition`

The **Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** represent the **sequential stages** a software project passes through — from gathering requirements to maintaining a deployed system. They ensure structure, accountability, and consistency throughout development.

### `Key Ideas`

- **1. Planning (Requirements / Analysis):**  
    Gather and prioritize requirements, define scope, assess risks, and estimate costs and timelines.  
    Output: **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document.
    
    - May include **prototyping** to clarify unclear requirements.
    
- **2. Design:**  
    Translate requirements into system architecture and interface design.  
    Define components, data flow, and technologies.  
    Output: **Design Document** for developers to follow.
    
- **3. Development (Implementation):**  
    Code the solution according to the design specifications.  
    Developers use tools, frameworks, and programming standards to build functional modules.
    
- **4. Testing:**  
    Validate that the system meets requirements and is stable, secure, and functional.  
    Includes **unit, integration, system,** and **acceptance testing**.  
    **Output**: Verified, production-ready software.
    
- **5. Deployment:**  
    Release the software into a **production environment**.  
    Often includes **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** before full rollout.
    
- **6. Maintenance:**  
    Monitor and improve the system after release.  
    Address bugs, UI issues, and enhancement requests, often restarting the SDLC for future versions.
