### `Definition`

**Design Documentation** describes **how the software will be built** to meet the approved requirements. It translates the _what_ from the requirements phase into the _how_ — defining the system’s architecture, components, interactions, and design decisions that guide development.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Serves as a **blueprint** for developers, architects, and testers.  
    It ensures the software system is structured, scalable, maintainable, and aligned with the original requirements.
    
- **Created During:**  
    The **Design Phase (Phase 2)** of the SDLC — immediately after requirements have been approved.
    
- **Contents:**  
    A design document usually includes:
    
    - **Architecture Overview:** High-level structure of the system (modules, layers, services).
        
    - **Component Design:** Description of each subsystem or module, its role, and interactions.
        
    - **Data Design:** Data models, database schemas, and relationships.
        
    - **Interface Design:** API definitions, UI mockups, and integration points.
        
    - **Security and Performance Considerations:** Design decisions around authentication, data flow, and optimization.
        
    - **Constraints and Dependencies:** Hardware, software, or external systems the design depends on.
    
- **Types of Design:**
    
    - **Conceptual Design:** Focuses on the overall architecture and key components.
        
    - **Technical Design:** Provides detailed specifications for implementation, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and data flow diagrams.
    
- **Use in Development:**  
    Acts as the **reference document** for developers during coding and for testers to understand the expected behavior of each component.
    
- **Maintenance:**  
    Should be updated as new features are added or architecture evolves to preserve alignment between documentation and implementation.
