### `Definition`

**Phase 6 – Maintenance** is the **final stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the software is monitored, updated, and improved after deployment. The goal is to ensure that the system continues to function correctly, remains secure, and adapts to evolving business or user needs.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Maintain system performance and reliability once the software is in production.  
    This phase keeps the product _useful, secure, and aligned_ with user expectations over time.
    
- **Main Activities:**
    
    - **Monitoring & Issue Detection:** Track performance, uptime, and errors using logging and observability tools.
        
    - **Bug Fixes & Patches:** Correct defects discovered post-release.
        
    - **Updates & Enhancements:** Add minor features, improve UX, or optimize performance without full redevelopment.
        
    - **Security Maintenance:** Apply vulnerability patches, manage dependencies, and ensure compliance.
        
    - **Change Management:** Handle requests for modifications systematically, with version control and approvals.
        
    - **Performance Tuning:** Adjust infrastructure or configuration for better scalability and efficiency.
        
    - **Documentation Updates:** Revise technical and user documentation to reflect any system changes.
    
- **Importance:**  
    Maintenance ensures the **longevity and stability** of a software system, reduces technical debt, and helps retain customer satisfaction.
    
- **Types of Maintenance:**
    
    - **Corrective:** Fixes bugs and errors.
    - **Adaptive:** Updates software for new environments or OS/hardware changes.
    - **Perfective:** Enhances existing features or performance.
    - **Preventive:** Refactors code or updates dependencies to prevent future issues.
