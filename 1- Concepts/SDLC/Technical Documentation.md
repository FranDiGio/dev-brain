### `Definition`

**Technical Documentation** explains the **internal workings, logic, and structure** of a software system. It is written primarily for **developers, engineers, and technical stakeholders** to understand, maintain, and extend the codebase efficiently.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Provides insight into _how the system operates_ under the hood.  
    Helps developers onboard quickly, debug effectively, and ensure long-term maintainability.
    
- **Audience:**
    
    - Software Developers
    - QA Engineers
    - System Architects
    - DevOps / Infrastructure Engineers
    
- **Contents:**  
    Common elements include:
    
    - **Inline Code Comments:** Explain logic, purpose, and edge cases in the source code.
        
    - **API Documentation:** Defines endpoints, methods, parameters, and expected responses.
        
    - **Architecture and Design Notes:** Outline high-level technical decisions and rationale.
        
    - **Setup & Configuration Guides:** Describe environment setup, dependencies, and deployment steps.
        
    - **Developer Guides:** Walkthroughs for extending or integrating with the system.
        
    - **Maintenance Guides:** Instructions for updates, troubleshooting, and scaling.
    
- **Best Practices:**
    
    - Keep documentation close to the code (e.g., using Markdown files, wikis, or tools like Swagger).
        
    - Update alongside code changes to avoid outdated or misleading information.
        
    - Automate generation of API or class references when possible.
    
- **Role in the SDLC:**  
    Created during **development** and **maintenance** phases.  
    Complements design and QA documentation by ensuring every technical detail is captured for future development.
