### `Definition`

**Phase 3 – Development** is the stage of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the system’s design is **translated into executable code**.  
Developers implement features, integrate components, and prepare the product for testing based on approved design and requirements documents.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    To **build the functional software** as defined in the design and requirements phases.  
    This phase transforms design blueprints into a working system using appropriate tools, frameworks, and programming languages.
    
- **Inputs:**
    
    - Design Documentation (technical specifications, architecture diagrams)
    - Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
    - System Architecture
    
- **Core Activities:**
    
    - **Coding & Implementation:**  
        Developers write, refactor, and commit code following defined standards and design guidelines.
        
    - **Environment Setup:**  
        Establish development environments, databases, and dependencies necessary for implementation.
        
    - **Code Reviews & Peer Programming:**  
        Practices like **Pair Programming** and peer reviews help maintain quality and consistency.
        
    - **Version Control:**  
        Use of tools like Git for branching, merging, and maintaining release history.  
        Version control supports collaboration and traceability.
        
    - **Continuous Integration (CI):**  
        Code is frequently merged and automatically tested to catch integration errors early.
        
    - **Unit Testing:**  
        Developers write tests to verify individual functions or modules before integration.
    
- **Outputs:**
    
    - A **functional build** ready for system and integration testing.
    - Updated **Technical Documentation** reflecting code structure and setup details.
    - A **Release Candidate** that meets requirements and passes preliminary quality checks.
    
- **Best Practices:**
    
    - Follow consistent **coding standards** and naming conventions.
    - Implement **automated testing and linting** to maintain code quality.
    - Keep documentation synchronized with the implementation.
    - Conduct **regular code reviews** to detect issues early.
