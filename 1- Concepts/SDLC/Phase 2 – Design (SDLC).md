### `Definition`

**Phase 2 – Design** is the stage of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the **requirements** gathered during planning are **translated into a detailed system architecture and design blueprint**. This phase defines _how_ the software will be built to meet the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the **SRS**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    To create a **technical foundation** for development by outlining the software’s structure, components, interfaces, and data flow. It ensures that developers and stakeholders share a unified vision of the system before coding begins.
    
- **Inputs:**
    
    - **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
    - **System Requirements Specification (SysRS)**
    - **User Requirements Specification (URS)**
    - Business and architectural constraints.
    
- **Core Activities:**
    
    - **High-Level Design (HLD):**  
        Defines the overall system architecture, modules, data flow diagrams, and external interfaces.  
        Focuses on how different components interact and integrate.
        
    - **Low-Level Design (LLD):**  
        Specifies the internal logic of individual modules — data structures, APIs, algorithms, and database schema.
        
    - **Prototyping (Optional):**  
        Creation of early mock-ups or functional models to validate assumptions or clarify requirements.
        
    - **Design Reviews:**  
        Stakeholders, architects, and senior engineers validate that the design aligns with requirements, performance goals, and security standards.
        
    - **Documentation:**  
        The output of this phase is a **Design Documentation** detailing architecture diagrams, component specifications, and implementation guidelines.
    
- **Outputs:**
    
    - Approved **Design Document(s)** for developers.
    - Updated **architecture and interface specifications**.
    - Potential **prototype** demonstrating key functionality or UI concepts.
    
- **Best Practices:**
    
    - Ensure design is **modular** and **scalable** for future growth.
    - Incorporate **security** and **performance** considerations early.
    - Maintain **traceability** between requirements and design components.
    - Use **UML diagrams** or architecture visuals for clarity and consistency.
