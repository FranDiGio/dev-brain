### `Definition`

A **service** is an independently deployed unit of functionality that exposes a well-defined interface—usually over a network—to provide capabilities to other services, applications, or clients.  
It represents a business capability rather than a technical module.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Independent Deployment:**  
    A service runs as its own process or runtime instance.
    
- **Network-Accessible:**  
    Communicates via standardized protocols (HTTP, messaging, gRPC, etc.).
    
- **Business-Oriented Boundary:**  
    Encapsulates a specific business function, such as payments or authentication.
    
- **Loose Coupling:**  
    Services depend only on each other’s contracts (APIs), not internal details.
    
- **Reusability Across Applications:**  
    Multiple systems can call the same service.
    
- **Scalability:**  
    Each service can scale independently based on demand.
    
- **Foundation for Distributed Systems:**  
    Forms the basis of SOA and microservices.
