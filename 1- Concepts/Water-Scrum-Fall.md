### `Definition`

**Water-Scrum-Fall** describes a **hybrid development pattern** where organizations combine **traditional Waterfall planning and deployment** with **iterative development in the middle**, often mistakenly believing they are practicing Agile.  

In reality, this model retains rigid upfront planning and delayed feedback, missing the core Agile principle of continuous delivery and customer responsiveness.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Waterfall Front & Back:**  
    Projects begin with extensive upfront planning (“fuzzy front end”) and end with a long, painful integration or deployment phase (“the last mile”).
    
- **Iterative Middle:**  
    Teams perform sprints or iterations during development, but these cycles lack true Agile feedback — no working product is delivered for customer review.
    
- **No Continuous Feedback:**  
    Without frequent deployment, teams cannot validate assumptions or pivot based on stakeholder input.
    
- **Illusion of Agility:**  
    While iterations exist, the mindset remains predictive and plan-driven, not adaptive and value-driven.
    
- **Common Causes:**
    
    - Legacy management structures still using command-and-control.
    - Separation between dev and ops teams (no DevOps integration).
    - Fear of releasing unfinished or incremental work.
