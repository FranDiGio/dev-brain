### `Definition`

**Cloud Computing** is the delivery of computing services — such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics — over the internet (“the cloud”).

Instead of owning physical hardware or infrastructure, users access scalable and on-demand resources managed by a cloud provider.

### `Key Ideas`

- **On-demand access:**  
    Resources can be provisioned or released automatically, without human intervention.
    
- **Scalability & elasticity:**  
    Cloud systems scale up or down instantly based on workload or demand.
    
- **Pay-as-you-go model:**  
    You pay only for what you use, reducing upfront infrastructure costs.
    
- **Service models:**  
    Cloud services are categorized into layers of abstraction — **IaaS**, **PaaS**, and **SaaS** — depending on what’s managed by the provider versus the user.
    
- **Deployment models:**  
    Clouds can be **public**, **private**, **hybrid**, or **community**, based on ownership and accessibility.
    
- **Automation and virtualization:**  
    Virtual machines and containers form the backbone of most cloud environments, allowing efficient multi-tenant resource sharing.
