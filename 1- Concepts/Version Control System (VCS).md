### `Definition`

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a system that tracks and manages changes to files—most commonly source code—over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate, keep a history of changes, and safely revert to previous versions when necessary.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Change Tracking:**  
    Records what changed, when it changed, and who made the change.
    
- **Collaboration:**  
    Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other’s work.
    
- **Version History:**  
    Maintains a complete history of revisions that can be reviewed or restored.
    
- **Branching & Merging:**  
    Supports parallel lines of development that can later be combined.
    
- **Safety & Recovery:**  
    Provides the ability to revert mistakes, debug regressions, and audit changes.
    
- **Foundation of Modern Development:**  
    Essential for teamwork, CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, and release management.
