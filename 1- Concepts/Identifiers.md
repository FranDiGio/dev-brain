### `Definition`

**Identifiers** are symbolic names used in programs to **refer to entities** such as variables, constants, functions, types, and other constructs. They allow developers to reference program elements in a **human-readable** way instead of using raw memory locations or machine-level representations.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Naming Abstraction**  
    Identifiers provide meaningful names for program elements, making code readable and maintainable.
    
- **Reference, Not Storage**  
    An identifier does not hold a value itself; it **refers** to an entity such as a value, function, or type.
    
- **Language Rules**  
    Each programming language defines rules for:
    
    - valid characters
    - case sensitivity
    - reserved keywords
    - naming constraints
    
- **Scope & Visibility**  
    Where an identifier can be accessed depends on its scope (block, function, module, global).
    
- **Binding**  
    Identifiers are bound to entities during compilation, interpretation, or runtime depending on the language.
    
- **Semantic Meaning**  
    Good identifiers communicate intent, not just mechanics.
