### `Definition`

**Zero Trust** is a **security model** that assumes no implicit trust — every access request must be **continuously verified**, regardless of user, device, or network location.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Never Trust, Always Verify:**  
    Every connection is authenticated and authorized dynamically.
    
- **Context-Aware Access:**  
    Evaluates identity, device health, location, and behavior in real time.
    
- **Micro-Segmentation:**  
    Restricts lateral movement within networks and cloud environments.
    
- **Integration with IAM:**  
    Relies heavily on strong IAM policies, MFA, and least-privilege enforcement.
