### `Definition`

**Methods** are named units of behavior associated with a **class or object**. They define the actions that can be performed using an object’s state and represent how objects expose and operate on their data.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Behavior Definition**  
    Methods describe what an object _can do_, not how it is stored or invoked internally.
    
- **Associated With Structure**  
    A method belongs to a class and is available on objects created from that class.
    
- **Operates on State**  
    Methods typically read or modify the object’s internal data.
    
- **Encapsulation Mechanism**  
    Provide controlled access to an object’s state through a defined interface.
    
- **Reusability**  
    Methods defined once in a class can be reused by all objects of that class.
    
- **Conceptual Separation from Execution**  
    How methods are called, dispatched, or resolved at runtime is handled by underlying mechanisms.
