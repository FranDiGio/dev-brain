### `Definition`

**IAM Policies** are the **rules and configurations** that define how identities can interact with systems and resources.  
They specify _who_ can perform _what actions_ on _which resources_ under _which conditions_.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Access Control Foundation:**  
    Enforces authentication, authorization, and least-privilege principles.
    
- **Policy Structure:**  
    Usually includes subjects (users/roles), actions (permissions), resources, and conditions (context).
    
- **Compliance Alignment:**  
    Supports internal security standards and external regulations (GDPR, ISO 27001, NIST).
    
- **Cloud Context:**  
    Cloud IAM services use JSON-based policy documents to define permissions programmatically.
