### `Definition`

**Boolean Logic** is a **logical system** that operates on binary values — **True** or **False** — forming the foundation of all computer decision-making.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Boolean Expressions:**  
    Mathematical statements that return either True or False (e.g., `x > 5`, `isLoggedIn == True`).
    
- **Boolean Variables:**  
    Variables that hold only two possible values, often used in conditional statements.
    
- **Operators:**
    
    - **AND (&&):** True if both conditions are True.
        
    - **OR (||):** True if at least one condition is True.
        
    - **NOT (!):** Inverts the condition’s value.
    
- **Use Cases:**  
    Used in _if-statements_, _loops_, _comparisons_, and _conditional rendering_ in almost every programming language.
