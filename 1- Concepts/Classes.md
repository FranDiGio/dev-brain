### `Definition`

A **class** is a blueprint that defines the **structure and behavior** of objects. It specifies what data an object can hold and what operations it can perform, without representing a concrete instance itself.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Template for Objects**  
    A class describes how objects should be constructed and behave.
    
- **Defines State**  
    Specifies the attributes or fields that objects created from it will have.
    
- **Defines Behavior**  
    Declares methods that operate on the object’s state.
    
- **Encapsulation Boundary**  
    Groups related data and behavior together behind a defined interface.
    
- **Supports Reuse & Organization**  
    Enables reuse of common structure and behavior across multiple objects.
    
- **Language-Specific Semantics**  
    Different languages define classes differently (visibility, inheritance, modifiers).
