### `Key Ideas`

- **Handles HTTP Requests:**  
    Responds directly to browser requests using HTTP/HTTPS.
    
- **Serves Static Content:**  
    Delivers assets like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and files efficiently.
    
- **Request Routing:**  
    Often forwards dynamic requests to an application server.
    
- **High Concurrency:**  
    Optimized to handle many simultaneous client connections.
    
- **Public-Facing Role:**  
    Commonly sits at the edge of the system, exposed to the internet.
