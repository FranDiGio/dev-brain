### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Automates repetitive tasks efficiently, reducing redundancy and human error.
    
- **Common Types:**
    
    - **While Loop:** Evaluates the condition _before_ each iteration.
    - **For Loop:** Iterates a fixed number of times using a counter.
    - **Do-While Loop:** Evaluates the condition _after_ executing the loop body (exit-controlled).
    
- **Example:**
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
- **Behavior:**  
    The loop continues until its Boolean condition returns **False**, at which point the program exits the loop.
    
- **Importance:**  
    Critical for processing lists, performing calculations, or monitoring real-time data.
