### `Definition`

**Product Documentation** describes the **functionality, design, and usage** of a software product.  
It serves as the **primary reference** for developers, testers, and users to understand how the system works, how it should be built, and how it should be used.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Product documentation provides a clear, detailed explanation of what the software does and how it achieves its goals.  
    It ensures all stakeholders—technical and non-technical—have a shared understanding of the system’s structure, features, and behavior.
    
- **Audience:**  
    Tailored for **developers**, **architects**, **QA teams**, and **end-users**, depending on the documentation type.
    
- **Main Types:**
    
    - **Requirements Documentation:** Defines what the software must do (URS, SRS, SysRS).
        
    - **Design Documentation:** Explains how the software is structured and how requirements are implemented.
        
    - **Technical Documentation:** Includes inline code comments, API references, and developer guides.
        
    - **Quality Assurance Documentation:** Covers testing strategy, cases, results, and traceability matrices.
        
    - **User Documentation:** Provides installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and usage instructions.
    
- **Lifecycle Integration:**  
    Product documentation is created and refined throughout the **SDLC**, starting in planning and continuing through development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
    
- **Maintenance:**  
    Documentation must evolve alongside the software. When features or UIs change, the related documentation must be updated accordingly.
