## `Definition`

**Infrastructure** refers to the **underlying hardware and software resources** that support the operation, deployment, and delivery of applications. It includes servers, networks, storage, and the platforms that allow software to run reliably, securely, and at scale—whether on-premises or in the cloud.

## `Key Ideas`

- **Foundation of software systems** → everything applications depend on to function (compute, storage, networking).
    
- **Evolution of environments** → from physical servers → virtual machines → containers → cloud-native platforms.
    
- **Abstraction and automation** → modern infrastructure uses virtualization, orchestration, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to improve efficiency.
    
- **Scalability and elasticity** → resources can scale up or down dynamically to meet demand.
    
- **Reliability and resilience** → high availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance are core design goals.
    
- **Security and governance** → infrastructure must include monitoring, access control, and compliance mechanisms.
    
- **Shift to cloud** → infrastructure is increasingly defined in software and managed as services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
