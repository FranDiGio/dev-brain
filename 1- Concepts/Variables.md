### `Definition`

**Variables** are named placeholders used to **store and reference values** in a program. They allow programs to retain data, manipulate it, and reuse it throughout execution.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Name–Value Association**  
    A variable associates an identifier with a value, giving the data meaning and context.
    
- **Abstraction over Storage**  
    Variables hide the details of where and how data is stored in memory.
    
- **Mutability**  
    Depending on the language and declaration, variables may allow their values to change over time.
    
- **Typed or Untyped**
    
    - In typed languages, variables are associated with a data type
    - In dynamic systems, the type may belong to the value instead
    
- **Scope & Lifetime**  
    Variables exist within defined boundaries (block, function, module, global) and for a limited duration.
    
- **Foundation of State**  
    Variables represent program state and enable computation beyond fixed values.
