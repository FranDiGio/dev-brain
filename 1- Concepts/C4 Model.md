### `Definition`

The C4 Model is a modern, visual approach to software architecture documentation that represents a system at four hierarchical levels: context, containers, components, and code. It provides a clear, scalable way to describe software architecture without the complexity of UML.

### `Key Ideas`

- Uses **four zoom levels** to explain architecture from high-level to code-level.
    
- Focuses on clarity: easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    
- Ideal for distributed systems, microservices, and cloud-based architectures.
    
- Replaces fragmented or overly complex diagramming approaches.
    
- Commonly used in modern development teams via tools like Miro, Lucidchart, or Excalidraw.
