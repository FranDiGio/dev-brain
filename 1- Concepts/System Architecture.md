## `Definition`

**Software architecture** refers to the **conceptual structure and design of a software system**, defining how its components interact, communicate, and function together to achieve the system’s goals. It provides the blueprint for how applications are organized — from monolithic designs to distributed, service-oriented, and microservice-based systems.

## `Key Ideas`

- **Structure and organization** → defines the main components, data flows, and interfaces of a system.
    
- **Evolution over time** → architectures have evolved from tightly coupled monoliths → modular SOA → lightweight microservices.
    
- **Separation of concerns** → breaking complex systems into manageable layers or services for flexibility and scalability.
    
- **Scalability and performance** → architecture choices determine how a system handles growth and load.
    
- **Maintainability** → good architecture supports easier testing, debugging, and feature updates.
    
- **Communication patterns** → synchronous (API calls) vs. asynchronous (messaging, event-driven systems).
    
- **Trade-offs** → every architecture involves balancing speed, cost, simplicity, and resilience.
    
- **Foundation for DevOps and CI/CD** → architecture affects how software can be deployed, monitored, and maintained continuously.
