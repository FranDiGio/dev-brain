### `Definition`

Architectural styles describe the fundamental ways software systems can be structured. They represent common design patterns—such as monolithic, layered, component-based, or service-oriented approaches—that shape how components interact, scale, and evolve.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Provide high-level blueprints for organizing applications.
    
- Define communication patterns, modularity, and separation of concerns.
    
- Influence scalability, maintainability, performance, and fault tolerance.
    
- Examples include monolithic, layered, component-based, SOA, and microservices architectures.
    
- A system architecture often combines multiple styles.
