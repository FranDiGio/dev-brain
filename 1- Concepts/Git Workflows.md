### `Definition`

**Git workflows** are structured approaches that define how branches, commits, merges, and reviews are used together to manage development in a Git-based project. They provide conventions that help teams collaborate safely and consistently.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Defines Collaboration Rules:**  
    Specifies which branches exist, how they’re named, and how changes flow between them.
    
- **Controls Integration into Main Branch:**  
    Protects stable code by regulating when and how changes are merged.
    
- **Scales With Team Size:**  
    Simple workflows suit small teams, while more structured workflows support large teams.
    
- **Built on Core Git Concepts:**  
    Uses branches, commits, merges, and pull requests as building blocks.
    
- **Common Workflow Types:**
    - _Feature Branch Workflow_
    - _GitFlow_
    - _Trunk-Based Development_
    
- **Often Enforced by Platforms:**  
    Tools like GitHub enforce workflows via branch protection and PR rules.

### `Challenges`

- Overly complex workflows slow development and increase friction.
    
- Poorly defined rules lead to inconsistent branching and messy history.
    
- GitFlow can be too heavy for fast-moving teams.
    
- Trunk-based development requires discipline and strong testing.
    
- Teams must align workflow choice with release and deployment strategy.
