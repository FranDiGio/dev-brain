### `Key Ideas`

- **Execution Unit:**  
    A node runs one or more services or processes.
    
- **Network-Addressable:**  
    Nodes communicate by sending and receiving messages over a network.
    
- **Independent Failure Domain:**  
    A node can fail without necessarily bringing down the entire system.
    
- **Scalable Building Block:**  
    Distributed systems scale by adding or removing nodes.
    
- **Heterogeneous:**  
    Nodes may differ in hardware, operating systems, or runtime environments.
