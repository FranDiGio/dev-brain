### `Definition`

A **database** is an organized system for storing and managing data so it can be reliably retrieved and updated over time. It provides structured persistence and defined guarantees around correctness, consistency, and accessibility, independent of any specific software implementation.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Persistence**  
    Data remains stored beyond the execution of a single program or session.
    
- **Structured Representation**  
    Information follows a defined model (e.g., relational, document, graph) that determines how data is organized and related.
    
- **Controlled Operations**  
    Data can be created, read, updated, and deleted through formal operations.
    
- **Integrity & Correctness**  
    A database aims to maintain valid and consistent data even under concurrent access or failure conditions.
    
- **Abstraction**  
    The concept of a database is independent of specific engines, tools, or storage mechanisms.
