### `Definition`

A **component** is a self-contained, reusable unit of software that encapsulates functionality behind a clear interface. It hides its internal implementation and exposes only what is necessary for other parts of the system to use.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Encapsulation:**  
    Internals (data + logic) are hidden behind a public interface.
    
- **Reusability:**  
    A well-designed component can be reused across multiple applications or contexts.
    
- **Replaceability:**  
    One component can be swapped for another if it implements the same interface.
    
- **Independence:**  
    Ideally has minimal dependencies on other components.
    
- **Extensibility:**  
    New behavior can be added without modifying other components.
    
- **Technology-Agnostic:**  
    The concept applies regardless of language, framework, or system architecture.
