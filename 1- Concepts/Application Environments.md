### `Definition`

**Application environments** are the distinct setups in which a software application runs during its lifecycle, each designed for a specific purpose such as development, testing, or production. They help isolate work, reduce risk, and ensure consistent behavior across stages.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Environment Separation:**  
    Different environments exist to avoid risky changes directly affecting users or live data.
    
- **Lifecycle Support:**  
    Applications typically move through environments as they mature—from building and testing to real-world usage.
    
- **Configuration Differences:**  
    Each environment may have different settings (databases, credentials, logging levels, feature flags).
    
- **Risk Management:**  
    Issues are ideally caught in non-production environments before reaching users.
    
- **Common Environment Types:**
    
    - **Development:** Active coding and experimentation
        
    - **Testing / QA:** Validation and verification
        
    - **Staging:** Production-like environment for final checks
        
    - **Production:** Live environment used by real users
    
- **Consistency Goal:**  
    Environments are designed to be as similar as possible to reduce “works on my machine” issues.
