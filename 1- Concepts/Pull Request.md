### `Definition`

A **pull request (PR)** is a mechanism for proposing changes from one branch to another and requesting review and approval before those changes are merged. It enables collaboration, discussion, and quality control in team-based development.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Proposes Integration:**  
    A pull request asks to merge committed changes from a source branch into a target branch (often main).
    
- **Code Review Workflow:**  
    Team members can review, comment on, and request changes before approval.
    
- **Gatekeeper for Main Branch:**  
    Helps protect stable branches from unreviewed or unsafe changes.
    
- **Tracks Responsibility:**  
    Records who proposed, reviewed, approved, and merged the changes.
    
- **Supports Incomplete Work:**  
    PRs can be opened early to gather feedback before final completion.
    
- **Tool-Specific Concept:**  
    Common in platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket (not part of core Git).
