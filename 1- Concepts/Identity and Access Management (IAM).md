### `Definition`

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a **security discipline** that ensures the right individuals and systems have the appropriate access to technology resources.  

It governs how identities are created, authenticated, authorized, and audited across an organization or cloud environment.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Identity Lifecycle Management:**  
    Processes for creating, maintaining, and deactivating user and system accounts.
    
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
    Verifying who a user is and determining what actions they’re allowed to perform.
    
- **Access Policies:**  
    Rules defining permissions, least privilege, password requirements, and session controls.
    
- **Centralized Access Control:**  
    IAM consolidates identity management through a single interface or directory (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, or Cloud IAM).
    
- **Identity Federation & SSO:**  
    Enables users to access multiple systems using a single set of credentials through standards like **SAML** and **OpenID Connect**.
    
- **Principle of Least Privilege:**  
    Users and applications receive only the minimal permissions required for their roles.
    
- **Zero Trust Alignment:**  
    Modern IAM integrates continuous verification, device checks, and context-based access control.
