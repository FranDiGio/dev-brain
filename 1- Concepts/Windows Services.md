### `Definition`

**Windows Services** describe the **model of long-running background processes** in Windows that provide system-level or application-level functionality without direct user interaction.

They represent how Windows structures **persistent, non-interactive work** in user space.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Background Execution Model**  
    Services run independently of logged-in users and are designed to operate continuously or on demand.
    
- **Lifecycle Management**  
    Services can be started, stopped, paused, resumed, or restarted according to system state or configuration.
    
- **System-Managed Identity**  
    Each service runs under a defined security context, controlling what resources it can access.
    
- **Event- and Request-Driven**  
    Services respond to system events, network requests, or inter-process communication rather than direct user input.
    
- **Core OS Abstraction**  
    Many fundamental Windows capabilities—networking, updates, authentication—are implemented as services.
    
- **Distinct from Applications**  
    Services are not tied to the desktop environment and do not expose graphical interfaces.
