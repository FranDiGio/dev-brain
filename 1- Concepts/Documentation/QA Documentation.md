### `Definition`

**Quality Assurance (QA) Documentation** captures all information related to the **testing strategy, execution, and validation** of a software product. It ensures that software quality objectives are clearly defined, tested, and verified throughout the development lifecycle.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Establishes a **structured approach** for verifying that the software meets its **requirements**, is free of defects, and performs as expected.  
    It serves as a **record of testing activity** and a **reference for continuous improvement**.
    
- **Audience:**  
    QA Engineers, Test Leads, Developers, Project Managers, and Stakeholders who review product quality metrics.
    
- **Contents:**  
    QA documentation can include:
    
    - **Test Plan:** Defines testing objectives, scope, tools, environments, and schedules.
        
    - **Test Strategy:** Outlines the overall testing philosophy, types of testing, and quality criteria.
        
    - **Test Cases / Scenarios:** Specify the inputs, expected outputs, and conditions for verification.
        
    - **Test Data:** Sample data sets used for validation.
        
    - **Traceability Matrix:** Maps requirements to their corresponding test cases to ensure full coverage.
        
    - **Bug Reports / Defect Logs:** Track issues found during testing and their resolutions.
        
    - **Test Summary Reports:** Provide results, metrics, and insights on product stability and readiness.
    
- **Lifecycle Role:**  
    QA documentation is created and refined during the **Testing Phase (Phase 4)** and updated throughout **Maintenance** to reflect ongoing quality efforts.
    
- **Best Practices:**
    
    - Keep documentation standardized and version-controlled.
        
    - Automate repetitive test documentation through CI/CD tools where possible.
        
    - Maintain alignment with requirements documentation (e.g., SRS, URS) to ensure tests validate actual needs.
