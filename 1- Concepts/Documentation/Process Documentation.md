    To guide team members through repeatable steps for completing technical or organizational tasks. It ensures that processes remain consistent even as teams change or scale.
    
- **Audience:**  
    Primarily written for **developers**, **QA engineers**, **DevOps**, **system administrators**, and other **internal stakeholders** who follow specific workflows.
    
- **Core Elements:**
    
    - **Process Overview:**  
        Describes the goal or outcome of the process (e.g., “Deploy a new release,” “Run a regression test suite”).
        
    - **Roles and Responsibilities:**  
        Specifies who performs each step and their permissions or dependencies.
        
    - **Step-by-Step Instructions:**  
        Detailed, ordered steps that define how to perform the process accurately and efficiently.
        
    - **Tools and Resources:**  
        Lists software tools, environments, scripts, or documents required to complete the task.
        
    - **Quality and Compliance Checks:**  
        Defines standards or checkpoints to ensure the process aligns with organizational or regulatory requirements.
        
    - **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):**  
        Process documentation is often supported by SOPs, which are **formalized, organization-specific step-by-step guides** for complex or critical tasks.
    
- **Maintenance:**  
    Must be regularly updated, especially after tool changes, workflow updates, or process optimizations. Outdated process docs can lead to miscommunication or quality issues.
