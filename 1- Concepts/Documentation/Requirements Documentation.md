### `Definition`

**Requirements Documentation** defines **what the software must do** — outlining the functional and non-functional needs that the final system must meet.  
It serves as a **contract** between stakeholders and developers, ensuring everyone understands the intended scope, features, and constraints before design and development begin.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Establishes a shared understanding of the product’s goals and functionalities.  
    Provides a foundation for **design**, **development**, and **testing** activities.
    
- **Created During:**  
    The **Planning Phase (Phase 1)** of the SDLC, often as part of the **Requirements Gathering Process**.
    
- **Key Components:**
    
    - **Functional Requirements:** Describe what the system should do — its operations, inputs, and expected outputs.
        
    - **External Interface Requirements:** Define interactions between the software and external entities (users, hardware, or other systems).
        
    - **System Features:** Outline specific capabilities or modules that make up the system.
        
    - **Non-Functional Requirements:** Specify quality attributes such as performance, reliability, security, and usability.
    
- **Main Artifacts:**
    
    - **User Requirements Specification (URS):** Captures user needs in the form of goals or user stories.
        
    - **Software Requirements Specification (SRS):** Details software behavior, scope, and constraints.
        
    - **System Requirements Specification (SysRS):** Defines broader system-level expectations, including hardware, policies, and performance standards.
    
- **Validation:**  
    Requirements should be reviewed and approved by stakeholders and serve as the basis for **test cases** and **acceptance criteria**.
