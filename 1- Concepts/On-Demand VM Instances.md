### `Definition`

Virtual machines that are **provisioned and billed per use**, with **no long-term commitment**.  
You can start, stop, or terminate them anytime and pay only for the compute time consumed.

### `Key Ideas`

- Flexible and ideal for **short-term or unpredictable workloads**.
    
- Simplifies experimentation and development since no pre-allocation is needed.
    
- More expensive over long durations compared to reserved options.
    
- Commonly known as **Pay-As-You-Go Instances** across providers.
