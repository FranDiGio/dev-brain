### `Definition`

A **distributed system** is a software system composed of multiple independent nodes that work together to appear as a single coherent system to the user. These nodes communicate by exchanging messages over a network.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Multiple Independent Nodes:**  
    The system runs across different machines or processes rather than a single runtime.
    
- **Network Communication:**  
    Nodes communicate through protocols such as HTTP, messaging, or RPC instead of shared memory.
    
- **Single System Illusion:**  
    Despite being spread out, the system behaves like one unified application from the user’s perspective.
    
- **Concurrency:**  
    Multiple components operate simultaneously, improving throughput and responsiveness.
    
- **Fault Tolerance:**  
    The system can continue operating even when individual nodes fail.
    
- **Scalability:**  
    Capacity can be increased by adding more nodes rather than upgrading a single machine.
    
- **Heterogeneity:**  
    Nodes may run on different hardware, operating systems, or programming languages.
