### `Definition`

Linked Lists are **linked data structures** made of nodes where each node stores a value and a reference to the next (and sometimes previous) node. They allow efficient insertions and deletions but have slower indexing compared to arrays or vectors.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Not stored in contiguous memory — built from linked nodes.
    
- No random access; must traverse from the head to reach an index.
    
- Insertions and deletions are fast when nodes are known.
    
- Ideal for workloads with frequent mid-structure modifications.

### `Big-O Performance`

|Operation|Time Complexity|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Access (at index)**|**O(n)**|Must traverse from the head|
|**Update (at index)**|**O(n)**|Same as access|
|**Append**|**O(1)** _if tail reference_ / **O(n)** otherwise|O(1) when list tracks the last node|
|**Insert (at random index)**|**O(n)**|Need to traverse to that index first|
|**Insert (after known node)**|**O(1)**|Direct pointer reassignment|
|**Delete (at random index)**|**O(n)**|Must find the node before it|
|**Delete (known node)**|**O(1)**|Pointer reassignment|
|**Search (unsorted)**|**O(n)**|Must check nodes sequentially|
|**Search (sorted)**|**O(n)**|No indexing; binary search impossible|
|**Space Complexity**|**O(n)**|Extra memory needed for node pointers|
