### `Definition`

**Cloud Network Security** refers to the set of **principles and controls** used to protect **network traffic, connectivity, and boundaries** within and between cloud environments. It focuses on **how data moves** in the cloud and how that movement is restricted, monitored, and secured.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Network as a Security Boundary**  
    In cloud environments, networks act as **logical security perimeters** rather than physical ones.
    
- **Traffic Control & Segmentation**  
    Cloud network security limits:
    
    - Who can talk to whom
    - From where
    - Over which protocols and ports
    
- **East–West vs North–South Traffic**
    
    - **North–South**: traffic entering or leaving the cloud (internet ↔ cloud)
    - **East–West**: traffic between internal cloud resources  
        Both require protection.
    
- **Identity-Aware Networking**  
    Access decisions are increasingly based on **identity and context**, not just IP addresses.
    
- **Provider-Native Constructs**  
    Security is implemented using logical constructs such as:
    
    - Virtual networks
    - Subnets
    - Security rules
    - Routing policies
    
- **Shared Responsibility Applies**  
    Cloud providers secure the underlying network infrastructure, while customers secure:
    
    - Network configuration
    - Access rules
    - Traffic exposure
