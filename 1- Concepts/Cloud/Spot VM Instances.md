### `Definition`

Virtual machines that use **spare capacity** from the cloud provider at a **deeply discounted rate**, but can be **interrupted or reclaimed** at any time.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Up to **90% cheaper** than on-demand instances.
    
- Also called **Spot Instances** (AWS) or **Preemptible VMs** (GCP).
    
- Ideal for **batch jobs, testing, or fault-tolerant workloads**.
    
- Must be designed to handle **sudden termination** gracefully.
