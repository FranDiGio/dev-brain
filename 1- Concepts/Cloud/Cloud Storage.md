### `Definition`

Cloud storage is a way of storing data on remote servers managed by a provider and accessed through the internet.  It can take different forms depending on how data is structured, accessed, and connected to compute resources.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Direct-Attached Storage (DAS):** Physical storage directly connected to a single compute node, offering low latency but limited scalability.
	
- **File Storage:** Data organized in files and folders, similar to a local filesystem.
    
- **Block Storage:** Data split into uniform blocks, often used for databases or virtual machines where performance matters.
    
- **Object Storage:** Data stored as complete “objects” with metadata and an ID, ideal for large amounts of unstructured data like images or backups.
    
- **Compute Node:** A server (physical or virtual) that performs computation and connects to storage systems to read and write data.
