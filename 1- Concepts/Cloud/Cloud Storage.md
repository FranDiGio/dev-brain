### `Definition`

Cloud storage is a service model where data is stored, managed, and maintained on **remote servers** provided by a **cloud service provider** and accessed via the **internet**.  

It abstracts away the physical hardware and exposes storage as a **scalable, on-demand resource**, billed by usage.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Service Model** 
	Delivered as part of **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service), allowing users to store data without managing hardware or maintenance.
    
- **Underlying Types** 
	Cloud storage implementations use traditional storage architectures such as **block**, **file**, and **object storage**, but delivered over a provider’s network.
    
- **Elasticity** 
	Capacity can be scaled up or down instantly to match workload demands.
    
- **Accessibility** 
	Data is accessible from anywhere with proper authentication and APIs.
    
- **Durability & Redundancy** 
	Cloud providers replicate data across multiple availability zones or regions for fault tolerance.
    
- **Security** 
	Encryption at rest and in transit, IAM controls, and data lifecycle policies are core features.
    
- **Examples**
    - **Object storage:** Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage
    - **Block storage:** AWS EBS, Azure Managed Disks, Google Persistent Disks
    - **File storage:** AWS EFS, Azure Files, Google Filestore
