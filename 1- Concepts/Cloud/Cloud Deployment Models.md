### `Definition`

**Cloud Deployment Models** describe **how and where** cloud computing resources are deployed, managed, and accessed.

They define the **ownership**, **control**, and **responsibility** of the infrastructure — determining who operates it, who uses it, and how it’s connected to other systems.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Public Cloud** →
    
    - Owned and operated by a third-party provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
    - Resources are shared among multiple tenants.
    - Offers scalability and cost efficiency but less control.
    
- **Private Cloud** →
    
    - Dedicated to a single organization, either on-premise or hosted by a vendor.
    - Offers higher security, compliance, and customization at a higher cost.
    
- **Hybrid Cloud** →
    
    - Combines public and private environments, enabling workload portability and flexibility.
    - Common in enterprises that balance control and scalability.
    
- **Community Cloud** →
    
    - Shared among organizations with common goals, such as government or healthcare sectors.
    - Balances cost with tailored compliance requirements.
    
- **Trade-offs:**
    
    - **Public** → scalable, low maintenance, less control.
    - **Private** → secure, customizable, higher maintenance.
    - **Hybrid** → flexible, complex integration.
