### `Definition`

**Cloud Monitoring** is the practice of **continuously observing and analyzing the performance, availability, usage, and security** of cloud resources and services.

It provides real-time visibility into system health and helps maintain reliability, cost efficiency, and compliance across cloud environments.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Multi-Layer Visibility:**  
    Monitoring occurs across multiple levels:
    
    - **Infrastructure Level:** Tracks virtual machines, containers, and networking health.
        
    - **Database Level:** Observes query performance, storage, and latency.
        
    - **Application Level:** Monitors uptime, API errors, and user experience metrics.
        
- **Operational Metrics:**  
    Includes system resource usage (CPU, memory, storage), application logs, API calls, and request throughput.
    
- **Security & Compliance Monitoring:**  
    Detects unauthorized access attempts, misconfigurations, or abnormal traffic patterns.
    
- **Billing & Cost Optimization:**  
    Tracks resource consumption and spending to identify inefficiencies or anomalies.
    
- **Tooling & Automation:**  
    Commonly uses cloud-native solutions like **AWS CloudWatch**, **Azure Monitor**, or **Google Cloud Operations Suite**, often integrated with alerting and dashboards (e.g., **Grafana**, **Prometheus**).
