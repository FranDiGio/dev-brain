### `Definition`

A **Composite Multicloud** environment uses **multiple public clouds simultaneously** for **a single workload or application**, distributing components across providers for performance, redundancy, or cost reasons.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Distributed architecture** 
	Parts of the same system (e.g., front-end, DB, analytics) run on different cloud providers.
    
- **Performance optimization** 
	Use each provider for what it does best — e.g., compute in AWS, AI in GCP, CDN in Azure.
    
- **High availability** 
	Increases fault tolerance and minimizes vendor risk.
    
- **Operational overhead** 
	Complex data syncing, monitoring, and identity management across platforms.
    
- **Typical use case** 
	Global SaaS platforms or high-reliability systems that need cross-provider failover.
