### `Definition`

**Cloud Security** is the discipline focused on **protecting cloud-based data, services, and infrastructure** from unauthorized access, attacks, and misconfigurations.

It applies cybersecurity principles to public, private, and hybrid cloud environments to ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Shared Responsibility Model:**  
    Defines which security duties belong to the cloud provider and which remain with the customer.
    
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):**  
    Monitors and corrects cloud misconfigurations, compliance gaps, and access risks.
    
- **Cloud Network Security:**  
    Protects data in transit and isolates workloads through segmentation and edge protection.
    
    - **Cloud Firewalls & IDS (Technology)** – Detect and block unauthorized network activity.
    
- **Cloud IAM:**  
    Manages user identities and access policies within the cloud.
    
    - **Cloud Zero Trust** – Continuous verification of every access request.
    
- **Cloud Data Security:**  
    Safeguards stored and transmitted data.
    
    - **Cloud Encryption
    - **Cloud DLP
    - **Cloud Governance & Compliance** – Ensures legal and regulatory adherence.
    
- **Emerging Cloud Security Trends:**
    
    - **Cybersecurity Mesh** – Unified security across multi-cloud.
    - **DevSecOps** – Security integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
    - **AI for Threat Detection** – Automated detection and response using ML.
