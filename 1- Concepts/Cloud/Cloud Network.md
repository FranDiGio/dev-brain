### `Definition`

**Cloud Networking** describes how **connectivity, routing, and traffic flow** are designed and managed between cloud resources, on-prem systems, and the internet using **software-defined network constructs**.

It focuses purely on **how things talk to each other** in the cloud.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Software-Defined Networks (SDN)**  
    Cloud networks are created and controlled through APIs rather than physical hardware.
    
- **Logical Isolation**  
    Cloud networking provides isolated network environments on shared infrastructure.
    
- **Traffic Flow Control**  
    Routing tables, gateways, and network boundaries determine where traffic can go.
    
- **Public vs Private Connectivity**  
    Cloud resources may communicate:
    
    - Privately within a cloud network
    - Publicly over the internet
    - Privately with on-prem or other clouds
    
- **Foundation for Performance & Security**  
    Networking decisions directly affect latency, availability, and security posture.
    
- **Provider-Native Constructs**  
    Each cloud implements networking using provider-specific abstractions, but the concepts remain consistent.
