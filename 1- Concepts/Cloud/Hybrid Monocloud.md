### `Definition`

A **Hybrid Monocloud** combines **public and private environments** from the **same cloud provider** — for example, using **AWS Cloud** and **AWS Outposts** together.

It merges the control of private infrastructure with the convenience and scale of a single provider’s public services.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Single-vendor ecosystem**
	Both private and public resources come from the same cloud provider.
    
- **Simplified integration** 
	Consistent tools, APIs, and management console across environments.
    
- **Ease of governance** 
	Security, networking, and identity management are unified.
    
- **Less flexibility** 
	Locked into one vendor’s ecosystem (vendor lock-in).
    
- **Example** 
	Using **Azure Arc** or **AWS Outposts** to extend a company’s private environment to the provider’s public cloud.
