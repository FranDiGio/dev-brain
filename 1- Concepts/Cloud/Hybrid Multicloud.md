### `Definition`

A **Hybrid Multicloud** architecture connects **multiple public clouds** with **private or on-prem infrastructure**, forming a mix of environments across **different providers**.

It’s the most flexible hybrid setup — blending private control with diverse public cloud services.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Cross-provider integration** → Combines clouds like AWS, Azure, and GCP with on-prem or private data centers.
    
- **Best-of-breed approach** → Choose different providers for specialized strengths (e.g., ML on GCP, storage on AWS).
    
- **Resilience & redundancy** → Avoids dependency on a single provider and improves uptime.
    
- **Operational complexity** → Requires orchestration and strong network design to maintain consistency.
    
- **Examples** → Using Kubernetes, Anthos, or Terraform to manage workloads across providers.
