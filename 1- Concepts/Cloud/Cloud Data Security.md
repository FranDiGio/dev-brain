### `Definition`

**Cloud Data Security** is the discipline focused on **protecting data stored, processed, and transmitted within cloud environments**.

It adapts general data security principles to cloud-specific architectures, ensuring data remains **confidential, integral, and available** across public, private, and hybrid clouds.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Shared Responsibility Context:**  
    Cloud providers secure infrastructure, while customers are responsible for protecting their data and access configurations.
    
- **Encryption Layers:**  
    Protects data **at rest**, **in transit**, and **in use**, using client-side or server-side encryption mechanisms and cloud-native key management tools.
    
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**  
    Detects and prevents unauthorized access or exfiltration of sensitive data across cloud services.
    
- **Governance & Compliance:**  
    Applies regulatory controls and auditing for frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO 27001.
    
- **Access Control Integration:**  
    Relies on **Cloud IAM** and **Zero Trust** principles to ensure only authorized entities can access or manipulate cloud data.
    
- **Visibility & Monitoring:**  
    Continuous assessment through Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools to identify misconfigurations and data exposure risks.
