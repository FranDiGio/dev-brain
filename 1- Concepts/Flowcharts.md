### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Visually map out the logical flow of a process or algorithm before coding, improving clarity and communication.
    
- **Core Symbols:**
    
    - **Oval (Start/End)** – Marks the beginning or end of a process.
    - **Rectangle (Process)** – Represents a computation or action.
    - **Diamond (Decision)** – Indicates a branch or condition (Yes/No).
    - **Parallelogram (Input/Output)** – Shows data entry or output.
    - **Arrows (Connectors)** – Define control flow direction.
    
- **Advantages:**
    
    - Makes logic easy to understand and present.
    - Helps identify redundant or missing steps early.
    - Great for **small-scale processes** and **educational or design discussions**.
    
- **Tools:**  
    Common software includes **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, **Microsoft Visio**, and **Miro**.
