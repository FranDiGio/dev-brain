### `Definition`

**Query languages** are specialized programming languages used to **communicate with databases** — primarily to **retrieve, manipulate, and manage data**. They form a bridge between users (or applications) and a **database management system (DBMS)**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Query languages express **requests for information** or **commands to modify data** in a structured, machine-readable form.  
    They are essential for **data access**, **reporting**, and **administration** tasks within databases.
    
- **Core Operations (CRUD):**  
    Query languages perform the four foundational database operations:
    
    - **Create** – Add new data or structures.
    - **Read** – Retrieve existing data.
    - **Update** – Modify existing data.
    - **Delete** – Remove data or records.
    
- **Types of Queries:**
    
    - **Select Queries:** Retrieve data (e.g., `SELECT * FROM customers;`).
        
    - **Action Queries:** Manipulate data (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
        
    - **Administrative Queries:** Manage users, permissions, and structures (e.g., `CREATE USER`, `ALTER TABLE`).
    
- **SQL vs NoSQL Context:**
    
    - **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Used for relational databases with predefined schemas.
        
    - **NoSQL:** Uses alternative query formats for flexible, non-relational data structures.
    
- **Examples of Query Languages:**  
    SQL, AQL, CQL, Datalog, DMX.
