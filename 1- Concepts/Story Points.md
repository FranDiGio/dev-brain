### `Definition`

**Story Points** are an **abstract unit of measure** used in Agile (especially Scrum) to estimate the **relative difficulty or effort** required to complete a **User Story**.  They represent **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** — _not_ time.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    To help teams estimate work _relatively_ instead of assigning exact durations.  
    Example: If Story A is a “5,” and Story B feels roughly twice as hard, Story B might be an “8.”
    
- **Factors Considered:**
    
    - **Effort** – How much work is needed?
        
    - **Complexity** – How difficult is the problem or system area?
        
    - **Uncertainty** – Have we done this before, or is it new territory?
        
- **Relative Estimation:**  
    Teams use a **baseline story** (a known “5”) and compare others to it: smaller (3), larger (8), etc.  
    The most common scale is a **Fibonacci sequence**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
    
- **Abstract Scale Examples:**
    
    - _Small (3):_ Simple, familiar story.
        
    - _Medium (5):_ Average effort, some unknowns.
        
    - _Large (8–13):_ Complex, needs research or spans multiple systems.
        
    - _>13:_ Too large — should be split or become an **Epic**.
        
- **Anti-Patterns:**
    
    - ❌ Converting story points into hours or days.
        
    - ❌ Assigning “1 = 1 day, 3 = 3 days…” — this defeats the abstraction.
        
    - ❌ Using points as a measure of individual productivity instead of **team velocity**.
        
- **Team Agreement:**  
    Each team must **agree on what “medium” means** so comparisons stay consistent within that team.
