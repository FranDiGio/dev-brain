### `Definition`

**Return values** are the outputs produced by a function after it completes execution. They allow a function to **communicate results back to its caller**, enabling composition and reuse of behavior.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Output of Computation**  
    A return value represents the result of the function’s logic.
    
- **Single or Multiple Values**  
    Some languages allow only one return value, while others support returning multiple values.
    
- **Optional Returns**  
    Functions may return nothing, indicating completion rather than a value.
    
- **Type Association**  
    Return values are often associated with a data type that defines what kind of value is produced.
    
- **Control Flow Impact**  
    Returning a value typically ends the function’s execution.
    
- **Composable Results**  
    Return values can be used as inputs to other functions or expressions.
