### `Key Ideas`

- **Core Objectives:**  
    Protect **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** (the CIA triad) of data at all times.
    
- **Lifecycle Protection:**  
    Security controls apply to data **at rest**, **in transit**, and **in use** — through encryption, access control, and monitoring.
    
- **Access Management:**  
    Ensures that only authorized users, processes, and devices can access specific data using IAM principles and least-privilege policies.
    
- **Data Classification & Governance:**  
    Organizes data based on sensitivity and compliance needs (e.g., PII, financial, or operational data).
    
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**  
    Monitors and prevents the unauthorized transfer or exfiltration of sensitive data.
    
- **Encryption & Key Management:**  
    Protects data confidentiality by encoding information and securing cryptographic keys.
    
- **Compliance & Regulations:**  
    Aligns with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 to ensure lawful and ethical data handling.
