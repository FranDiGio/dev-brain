### `Definition`

**Serverless computing** is a **cloud computing paradigm** where developers run code without managing servers or infrastructure.

The cloud provider automatically provisions resources, scales on demand, and bills only for actual execution time.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Abstraction of Infrastructure:**  
    Developers focus solely on application logic — not servers, runtimes, or scaling.
    
- **Event-Driven Model:**  
    Code executes in response to triggers like HTTP requests, file uploads, or scheduled events.
    
- **Granular Resource Management:**  
    Resources scale up or down automatically, and idle time incurs no cost.
    
- **Stateless Execution:**  
    Each function invocation is isolated; persistent data lives in external storage.
    
- **Concept vs Implementation:**  
    Serverless is the _conceptual paradigm_ — **Function as a Service (FaaS)** is the _technical model_ that realizes it (e.g., AWS Lambda, Firebase Cloud Functions).
