### `Purpose`

This vault serves as a **central, structured knowledge system** for everything related to software development, engineering, and technology.  
Its purpose is to:

- Capture everything I learn or build in tech.
- Connect abstract ideas to real-world implementations.
- Reflect how I _think_ about development, not just how it’s taught.

### `Scale Rule`

Use **folders for ecosystems**, not for isolated topics.

|Type|Example|Folder?|Why|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Ecosystem**|JavaScript, Python, Azure, AWS, Linux|✅ Yes|These grow fast and branch into multiple files (concepts, APIs, patterns, etc.).|
|**Isolated Concept**|REST API, Docker, SOLID Principles|❌ No|They work best as single notes or a couple of linked ones.|
|**Cross-cutting Area**|DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, Frontend|⚙️ Maybe|These can be top-level **Domains**, with subfolders if they grow large.|

### `Naming Conventions`

- Use **Title Case** in note names (`System Architecture`, `Virtual Machines`, `Agile Manifesto`).
    
- Avoid unnecessary symbols; use underscores only when needed (`CI_CD Pipelines`).
    
- Always link other notes with `[[Note Name]]` syntax rather than folders or paths.
    
- Each folder represents a conceptual layer — notes link _across_, not _within_.

---
### `General Rules`

- Write concisely and in your own words.
- Prefer connections (`[[Note]]`) over long explanations.
- Use code blocks and Mermaid diagrams where visual structure helps.
