### `Definition`

**Kanban** is a **visual workflow management methodology** focused on improving efficiency, limiting bottlenecks, and achieving continuous delivery.

It originated from **Toyota’s manufacturing system**, where visual “signboards” (kanban) were used to signal work stages and control production flow.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Visualize the Workflow:**  
    Represent tasks on a board divided into stages (e.g., _To Do → In Progress → Done_) to improve clarity and coordination.
    
- **Limit Work in Progress (WIP):**  
    Restrict how many items can be in a given stage to prevent overload and ensure smooth flow.
    
- **Manage Flow:**  
    Focus on moving tasks efficiently through the pipeline rather than starting more work.
    
- **Explicit Policies:**  
    Define clear rules for each column (e.g., what qualifies as “done” or “ready for review”).
    
- **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen):**  
    Teams regularly reflect and adapt their process based on metrics like lead time and throughput.

---
### `Challenges`

- **Lack of Timeboxing:**  
    Without iteration boundaries (like in Scrum), improvement cycles may feel less structured.
    
- **Too Much Flexibility:**  
    Teams may struggle with priority management if WIP limits or policies aren’t enforced.
    
- **Metrics Misuse:**  
    Overemphasis on speed can harm quality if not balanced with sustainable practices.
