### `Definition`

**Declarative Programming** is a programming paradigm where developers specify **what outcome they want**, not **how to achieve it**, leaving the execution details to the underlying system or runtime.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Focus on Intent**  
    Code describes desired results rather than step-by-step procedures.
    
- **Execution Abstracted Away**  
    Control flow and state transitions are handled by the language or runtime.
    
- **High-Level Expressions**  
    Programs are composed of rules, expressions, or constraints.
    
- **Reduced Side Effects**  
    Often discourages or hides mutable state.
    
- **Common in Domain-Specific Languages**  
    Widely used in query languages, configuration languages, and UI definitions.
    
- **Composable Descriptions**  
    Complex behavior emerges from combining simple declarations.

### `Challenges`

- **Loss of Control**  
    Developers may have limited influence over performance or execution order.
    
- **Debugging Difficulty**  
    Failures can be harder to trace due to hidden execution logic.
    
- **Limited Expressiveness**  
    Some problems are awkward or inefficient to express declaratively.
    
- **Runtime Dependence**  
    Heavily reliant on the correctness and performance of the underlying engine.
