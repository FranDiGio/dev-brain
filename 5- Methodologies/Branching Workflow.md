### `Definition`

A **branching workflow** is a structured process that defines how branches, commits, pull requests, and merges are used together to develop, review, and release code safely and collaboratively.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Common Base:**  
    Development starts from a stable branch (usually `main`).
    
- **Feature Isolation:**  
    Changes are made in separate branches to avoid impacting stable code.
    
- **Incremental Commits:**  
    Work is saved as commits with clear, descriptive messages.
    
- **Review via Pull Requests:**  
    Changes are proposed, reviewed, discussed, and approved before integration.
    
- **Controlled Merging:**  
    Approved changes are merged back into the main branch.
    
- **Branch Cleanup:**  
    Completed branches are deleted to keep the repository clean.
    
- **Scales with Team Size:**  
    Can remain simple for small projects or expand into more formal strategies.
