### `Definition`

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a **software development methodology** where tests are written **before** the actual code. The goal is to ensure the software is **built right** — meaning it fulfills its intended behavior with clean, reliable, and maintainable code. 

TDD emphasizes designing code through the lens of tests, shaping both functionality and architecture iteratively.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Test-first approach** → Write a failing test before writing any production code.
    
- **Red–Green–Refactor cycle** →
    
    1. **Red:** Write a test that fails.
        
    2. **Green:** Write minimal code to make the test pass.
        
    3. **Refactor:** Improve the code’s structure while keeping tests green.
    
- **Design through tests** → Tests act as specifications, guiding how the code should behave.
    
- **Confidence and speed** → Automated tests allow rapid iteration, early bug detection, and safer refactoring.
    
- **Supports CI/CD** → Continuous testing integrates naturally into DevOps pipelines, enabling reliable deployments.

### `Challenges`

- **Initial slowdown** → Writing tests first takes longer at the start but pays off with fewer regressions later.
    
- **Over-testing or under-testing** → Poorly scoped tests can slow development or miss edge cases.
    
- **False sense of security** → Passing tests don’t guarantee correct behavior if the tests themselves are incomplete or unclear.
    
- **Cultural resistance** → Teams new to TDD often struggle to adopt the discipline of writing tests before code.
