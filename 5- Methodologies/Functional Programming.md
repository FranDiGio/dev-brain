### `Definition`

**Functional Programming** is a programming paradigm that structures programs around **pure functions**, **immutable data**, and **explicit data flow**, emphasizing computation as the evaluation of expressions rather than the execution of commands.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Pure Functions**  
    Functions produce the same output for the same input and avoid side effects.
    
- **Immutability**  
    Data is not modified in place; instead, new values are produced from existing ones.
    
- **Function Composition**  
    Complex behavior is built by combining small, reusable functions.
    
- **Declarative Style**  
    Focuses on _what_ should be computed rather than _how_ to perform each step.
    
- **First-Class Functions**  
    Functions can be passed, returned, and stored like any other value.
    
- **Explicit Data Flow**  
    State changes are represented through transformations, not hidden mutations.

---
### `Challenges`

- **Learning Curve**  
    Requires a shift in thinking for developers used to imperative styles.
    
- **Performance Considerations**  
    Immutability can introduce memory and allocation overhead if not optimized.
    
- **Debugging Stack Traces**  
    Heavy composition can make call flows harder to follow.
    
- **Interoperability**  
    Integrating with stateful or imperative APIs can be awkward.
    
- **Not Always Intuitive**  
    Some problems are more naturally expressed imperatively.
