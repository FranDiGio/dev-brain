### `Definition`

Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that organizes software around objects—bundles of data and the methods that operate on that data. It models programs using real-world entities and their interactions.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Code is organized into **classes** that produce **objects**.
    
- Objects contain **state (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)**.
    
- Core principles often include **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**.
    
- Encourages modeling real-world concepts as interacting entities.
    
- Commonly used in languages like Java, C#, Python, and C++.

---
### `Challenges`

- Overuse of abstractions can create **bloated class hierarchies**.
    
- Inheritance misuse can lead to tight coupling.
    
- Requires careful design to avoid unnecessary complexity.
    
- Can be slower to execute compared to procedural or functional styles depending on implementation.
