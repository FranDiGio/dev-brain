### `Definition`

A **framework** is a **structured software platform or scaffold** that defines the overall architecture of an application. It provides pre-defined conventions, workflows, and components that guide development.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Inversion of Control:**  
    In frameworks, **the framework calls your code**, not the other way around — known as the _Hollywood Principle_:  
    _“Don’t call us, we’ll call you.”_
    
- **Opinionated Structure:**  
    Frameworks enforce specific design patterns and organization (e.g., MVC, MVVM).  
    This ensures consistency across large projects.
    
- **Extensive Scope:**  
    Frameworks often include built-in libraries for routing, templating, and testing.  
    Examples: Django, Spring Boot, Angular, .NET.

### `Use Cases`

- Building full-featured web applications (Django, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET)
    
- Developing APIs and microservices (Express.js, Flask)
    
- Creating front-end single-page apps (React, Angular, Vue)
    
- Structuring enterprise applications with consistent design standards
