### `Definition`

A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) visually represents how data moves through a system. It shows processes, data stores, external entities, and the flow of data between them, focusing on _what_ happens to data rather than _how_ it is implemented.

### `Key Ideas`

- Models **data movement**, not code or structure.
    
- Uses four core elements: processes, data stores, data flows, and external entities.
    
- Helps identify inputs, outputs, and transformations.
    
- Useful for analyzing business processes and system workflows.
    
- Commonly created before defining system architecture or database design.
