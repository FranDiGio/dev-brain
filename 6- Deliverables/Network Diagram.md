### `Definition`

A **Network Diagram** is a **visual representation of network components and their connections**, showing how devices, services, and network segments communicate with each other.

It focuses on **connectivity, topology, and data paths** rather than application logic.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Topology-Focused**  
    Shows how components are connected, such as:
    
    - Clients
    - Servers
    - Switches
    - Routers
    - Firewalls
    - Subnets
    
- **Logical vs Physical Views**  
    Can represent:
    
    - **Logical networks** (VPCs, subnets, security zones)
    - **Physical networks** (cables, switches, on-prem hardware)
    
- **Traffic Flow Awareness**  
    Often implies or explicitly shows:
    
    - Direction of traffic
    - Trust boundaries
    - Entry and exit points
    
- **Abstraction Level Varies**  
    Can be:
    
    - High-level (zones and services)
    - Detailed (IPs, ports, routing paths)
    
- **Infrastructure-Oriented**  
    Commonly used to explain **how systems are reachable and protected**, not how code executes.
