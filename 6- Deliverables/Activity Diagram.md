### `Key Ideas`

- Models **workflows and processes**, not object interactions.
    
- Focuses on **actions**, **decisions**, and **control flow**.
    
- Uses:
    
    - **Actions** to represent tasks or steps
    - **Decision nodes** to show branching logic
    - **Merge nodes** to reunite paths
    - **Start and end nodes** to define process boundaries
    
- Can represent **sequential**, **parallel**, and **conditional** flows.
    
- Useful for understanding:
    
    - business processes
    - system behavior
    - algorithm logic at a high level
