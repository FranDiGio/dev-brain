It serves as an authoritative reference for **repeatable operational work**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Execution-Focused Document**  
    SOPs describe **exact actions**, not principles or theory.
    
- **Repeatability & Consistency**  
    Ensures the same task is performed the same way regardless of:
    
    - Who executes it
    - When it is executed
    
- **Human-Readable and Prescriptive**  
    Written for people to follow directly, often including:
    
    - Preconditions
    - Ordered steps
    - Validation checks
    - Expected outcomes
    
- **Operational Scope**  
    Typically covers:
    
    - Routine operations
    - Incident handling
    - Maintenance tasks
    - Administrative processes
    
- **Derived from Practices & Methodologies**  
    SOPs operationalize:
    
    - Engineering practices
    - Team processes
    - Organizational standards
    
- **Living Documents**  
    SOPs are updated as systems, tools, or processes change.
