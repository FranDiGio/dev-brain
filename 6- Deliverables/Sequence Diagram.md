### `Definition`

A **sequence diagram** is a **behavioral diagram** that shows how multiple components or actors **interact over time**, emphasizing the **order of messages and calls** exchanged during a specific scenario.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Focuses on **time-ordered interactions** between participants.
    
- Participants are represented as **lifelines**, arranged horizontally.
    
- Interactions are shown as **messages** flowing vertically from top to bottom.
    
- Captures a **single scenario or use case**, not overall system structure.
    
- Commonly used to model:
    
    - request–response flows
    - service interactions
    - method calls between objects
    - user–system interactions
	
- Helps identify responsibilities, dependencies, and communication patterns.
