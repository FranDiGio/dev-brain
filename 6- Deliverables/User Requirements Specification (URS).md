### `Definition`

A **User Requirements Specification (URS)** defines the **needs and expectations of end users** for a software system. It focuses on **what users want to achieve**, rather than how the system will implement those goals, making it the most user-centered form of requirement documentation.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Captures the **business objectives** and **user-level needs** that justify the software’s development.  
    Acts as the foundation for the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**, where those needs are translated into technical terms.
    
- **Structure:**  
    Commonly expressed through **user stories** or **use cases** that answer three key questions:
    
    - **Who** is the user?
    - **What** do they need to do?
    - **Why** do they need it (business value or motivation)?
    
- **Validation:**  
    Used as the baseline for **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** — confirming whether the final product meets user expectations.
    
- **Relationship to Other Docs:**  
    The URS feeds into the **SRS**, which defines how each user requirement will be technically implemented.
