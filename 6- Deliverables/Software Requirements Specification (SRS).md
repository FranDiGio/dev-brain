### `Definition`

A **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** is a detailed document that defines **what a software system must do** and the **constraints** under which it operates.  

It serves as a **contract** between stakeholders and developers, ensuring everyone shares a clear, testable understanding of the product’s goals and behaviors.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Translates business objectives into clear, measurable requirements.  
    Provides a foundation for design, testing, and validation throughout the SDLC.
    
- **Structure:**  
    
    - **Introduction:** Purpose, scope, assumptions, dependencies.
        
    - **Overall Description:** Product perspective, user needs, constraints.
        
    - **Requirements:**
        
        - **_Functional_** – What the system should do (features, workflows).
        - **_External Interface_** – Interactions with users, hardware, or other systems.
        - **_System Features_** – Core functionalities derived from business goals.
        - **_Non-functional_** – Qualities like performance, reliability, security, and usability.
    
- **Traceability:**  
    Each requirement is uniquely identifiable so it can be tracked from definition to testing.
    
- **Relationship to Other Docs:**  
    Built from the **User Requirements Specification (URS)** and sometimes complemented by a **System Requirements Specification (SysRS)** for broader system-level needs.
