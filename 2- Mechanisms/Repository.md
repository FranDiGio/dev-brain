### `Definition`

A **repository** is a central storage location that contains a project’s files, version history, and metadata. It serves as the fundamental unit of organization in a version control system.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Container for Versioned Data:**  
    Holds source code, configuration files, and the complete change history.
    
- **Tracks History:**  
    Every change made to files in a repository is recorded and can be reviewed or restored.
    
- **Supports Collaboration:**  
    Multiple contributors can work within the same repository using branches and commits.
    
- **Local and Remote Forms:**  
    Repositories can exist locally on a developer’s machine or remotely on a hosting platform.
    
- **Enables Workflows:**  
    Branching, merging, and reviews all revolve around the repository.
    
- **Tool-Agnostic Concept:**  
    Repositories exist in many version control systems, not just Git.
