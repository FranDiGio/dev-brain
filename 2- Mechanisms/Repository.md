### `Definition`

A **repository** provides a **structured place to store files along with their change history and metadata** as a single unit. It serves as the organizational boundary within which versioned work is tracked and managed.

---
### `How It Works`

Files and their changes are recorded within the repository over time, forming a history of snapshots.  

Operations such as committing, branching, cloning, and merging all act within the context of a repository, using it as the reference point for state and history.

Repositories may exist locally or remotely while maintaining the same logical structure.
