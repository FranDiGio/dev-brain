### `Definition`

The **main branch** is the authoritative branch of a repository that represents the **stable, deployable version** of the code. It serves as the single source of truth for the current state of the application.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Definitive Codebase:**  
    The code in the main branch is considered production-ready or release-ready.
    
- **Created by Default:**  
    Most repositories start with a main branch, though its name and role can be customized.
    
- **Protected From Direct Changes:**  
    Changes are usually merged into the main branch only after review and approval.
    
- **Integration Point:**  
    Feature or fix branches eventually merge back into main.
    
- **Deployment Anchor:**  
    CI/CD pipelines often trigger deployments from the main branch.
    
- **Stability Over Speed:**  
    Emphasizes correctness and reliability over rapid experimentation.
