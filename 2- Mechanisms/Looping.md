### `Definition`

**Looping** enables a program to **repeat execution of a set of instructions** while a specified condition holds. It allows repeated behavior without duplicating code.

### `How It Works`

A condition is evaluated to determine whether the loop body should execute. If the condition evaluates to true, the instructions inside the loop run and control returns to the condition check.  

This cycle continues until the condition evaluates to false, at which point execution proceeds past the loop.

Different loop forms determine when the condition is checked and how iteration is controlled.

### `Why It Exists`

- To automate **repetitive tasks**
    
- To process collections or sequences of data
    
- To perform iterative calculations or monitoring
    
- To reduce code duplication and improve clarity
