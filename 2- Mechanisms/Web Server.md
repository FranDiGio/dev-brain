### `Definition`

A **web server** handles **incoming client requests** and delivers content over web protocols, acting as the primary entry point for web-based interactions. It manages request reception and response delivery for web-facing systems.

---
### `How It Works`

Client requests are received over protocols such as HTTP or HTTPS.  

The web server processes these requests and either serves the requested content directly or forwards the request to another system component for further handling.

Responses are then sent back to the client, often while managing many concurrent connections efficiently.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To provide a **reliable interface** between clients and backend systems
    
- To efficiently serve **static content** at scale
    
- To manage **concurrent web traffic**
    
- To separate request handling from application logic
