### `Definition`

**Identifiers** provide a way to **name and reference elements within a program**, allowing code to refer to values, operations, and structures symbolically instead of through raw memory locations.

They enable humans and compilers to associate meaning with program elements.

---
### `How It Works`

When a program is processed, identifiers are bound to specific entities such as variables, functions, or types according to the language’s rules.

During execution or compilation, these names are resolved to their corresponding memory locations, values, or executable logic based on scope and visibility rules. The resolution process determines which entity an identifier refers to at any given point.

### `Why It Exists`

- To make programs **readable and maintainable**
    
- To allow symbolic reference to data and behavior
    
- To support structured reasoning about program logic
    
- To separate **human meaning** from low-level memory representation
