### `Definition`

Identifiers are the names used to **reference components inside a program** — such as variables, constants, functions, methods, classes, and interfaces. They act as human-readable labels that point to stored values or executable logic.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose**  
    Identifiers allow developers to refer to data or behavior in a program. Without them, everything would rely on raw memory locations, making programs unreadable and unmaintainable.
    
- **Human–Readable Labels**  
    They make code understandable by giving meaning to values (e.g., `totalPrice` instead of a raw memory slot).
    
- **Language Rules Apply**  
    Every programming language defines how identifiers can be structured (allowed characters, case sensitivity, reserved keywords).
    
- **Link to Stored Values**  
    For stored values, the identifier is simply the label that points to a value in memory (e.g., a number, string, object, or reference).
    
- **Part of Program Semantics**  
    How identifiers are scoped, resolved, shadowed, or reused depends on the language’s semantics (e.g., block scope vs function scope).
