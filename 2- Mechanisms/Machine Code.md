### `Definition`

**Machine code** represents the **direct instruction format executed by a CPU**, consisting of binary-encoded operations that control hardware behavior. It defines the lowest execution layer through which software interacts with processor hardware.

---
### `How It Works`

Binary instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed by the CPU according to the processor’s instruction set architecture.  

Each instruction encodes a specific operation, such as arithmetic computation, memory access, or control flow change, and operates directly on registers or memory.

Execution proceeds sequentially unless altered by control instructions.

### `Why It Exists`

- To provide a **direct interface** between software and hardware
    
- To enable **precise and efficient execution** of computations
    
- To serve as the **final execution form** of all programs
    
- To define the foundational behavior of processor architectures
