### `Definition`

**Machine code** is the **lowest-level set of binary instructions** that a CPU can execute directly.  
These instructions are represented as sequences of 0s and 1s and correspond to hardware-level operations like arithmetic, memory access, and control flow.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Binary Instructions:**  
    CPUs execute instructions encoded as binary numbers (opcodes + operands).
    
- **Architecture-Specific:**  
    Machine code depends on the CPU architecture (x86, ARM, RISC-V).
    
- **No Abstraction:**  
    There are no variables, loops, or functions — only hardware-level operations.
    
- **Generated by Tools:**  
    Compilers, assemblers, and linkers translate higher-level programs into machine code.
    
- **Fastest Execution Layer:**  
    It runs directly on hardware with no interpretation overhead.
