### `Definition`

A **database server** is a **mechanism for managing persistent data storage and access** within a system, enabling applications to store, retrieve, and modify data reliably over time. It provides a centralized point for durable data handling.

---
### `How It Works`

Applications or services issue requests to store or retrieve data, which are processed by the database server. 

The mechanism manages data persistence, enforces structure and constraints, coordinates concurrent access, and ensures data durability across failures.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To provide **reliable, long-term data persistence**
    
- To centralize **data access and coordination**
    
- To support **concurrent use** by multiple system components
    
- To maintain **data integrity and consistency** across operations
