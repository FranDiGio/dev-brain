### `Definition`

A **clone** is a **mechanism for creating a complete local replica of a repository**, including its files and history, from an existing source. It enables independent local interaction with a version-controlled codebase.

---
### `How It Works`

A repository’s data is copied from a source location into a new local repository. 

This process reproduces the project’s file state and version history, allowing local changes to be recorded independently while remaining synchronizable with the original source.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **local development** without direct interaction with the source repository
    
- To allow **offline work** with full project history
    
- To support **distributed version control workflows**
    
- To provide a starting point for contributing changes
