### `Definition`

A **runtime environment** provides the **execution context in which a program runs**, supplying services such as memory handling, execution control, and access to system capabilities.

It defines how program instructions are executed and how they interact with underlying system resources.

### `How It Works`

When a program starts, it runs within a runtime environment that manages its execution lifecycle.  

The runtime coordinates tasks such as memory allocation, execution flow, interaction with libraries, and communication with the operating system.

Depending on the execution model, the runtime may interpret instructions, manage compiled code, or enforce safety and isolation rules during execution.

### `Why It Exists`

- To abstract low-level system details from application logic
    
- To provide a consistent execution context across environments
    
- To manage resources such as memory and execution state
    
- To support different execution models and language features
