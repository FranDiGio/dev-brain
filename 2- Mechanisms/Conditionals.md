### `Definition`

**Conditionals** are the mechanism that allows a program to **evaluate a condition and decide whether a block of code should execute** based on the result.

---
### `How It Works`

- A condition is evaluated as **true or false**.
    
- If the condition is true, the associated code block executes.
    
- If false, execution either:
    
    - skips the block, or
    - transfers to an alternative branch.
    
- Conditions are usually built from:
    
    - boolean expressions
    - comparison operators
    - logical operators
    
- Evaluation happens at runtime, during normal program execution.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **decision-making** in programs.
    
- To allow behavior to change based on input, state, or environment.
    
- To avoid executing code unconditionally.
    
- To form the foundation of branching and complex control flow.
    
- To express logic in a structured, readable way.
