### `Definition`

**Authentication & session management** is a **mechanism for verifying identity and maintaining continuity of access** across system or application interactions.

It enables systems to recognize _who_ is interacting and to preserve that identity across multiple operations over time.

---
### `How It Works`

Identity is first established through an authentication step, where credentials or proofs are validated. Once authenticated, a session is created to represent the ongoing interaction, allowing subsequent requests to be associated with the same identity.

The mechanism relies on session identifiers, tokens, or system-level contexts that are tracked, validated, and eventually expired to prevent misuse.

### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **secure identity verification** in multi-user systems
    
- To maintain **continuity of access** across multiple interactions
    
- To enforce **controlled access** to resources over time
    
- To support **stateful interaction** without repeated authentication
    
- To reduce security risks through **session lifecycle management**
