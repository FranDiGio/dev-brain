### `Definition`

**Control flow** is a **mechanism that determines the order in which instructions are executed** within a program. It governs how execution progresses, branches, repeats, or terminates based on logic and state.

---
### `How It Works`

As a program runs, control flow directs execution from one instruction to the next.  
Decision points evaluate conditions to select execution paths, while looping constructs redirect execution back to earlier points.

Special control statements can alter the normal sequence by exiting, skipping, or returning from execution contexts.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **structured execution** of instructions
    
- To support **decision-making and repetition**
    
- To allow programs to respond dynamically to **data and state**
    
- To define predictable and understandable program behavior
