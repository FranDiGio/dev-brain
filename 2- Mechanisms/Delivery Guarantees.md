### `Definition`

**Delivery Guarantees** describe the **promises a messaging system makes about how many times a message may be delivered and processed**, especially in the presence of failures. They define the balance between **reliability, duplication, and complexity**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **At-Most-Once**  
    A message is delivered **zero or one time**.
    
    - No retries
    - Messages may be lost
    - Lowest latency, simplest handling
    
- **At-Least-Once**  
    A message is delivered **one or more times** until acknowledged.
    
    - Retries enabled
    - Duplicates possible
    - Most common guarantee in practice
    
- **Exactly-Once**  
    A message is processed **once and only once**.
    
    - No loss, no duplication
    - Requires coordination, idempotency, or transactions
    - Highest complexity and cost
    
- **Guarantees Are End-to-End**  
    True delivery guarantees depend on:
    
    - Acknowledgements
    - Retry behavior
    - Consumer logic (idempotency)
    - Broker or framework capabilities
    
- **Trade-offs Are Inevitable**  
    Stronger guarantees typically increase:
    
    - Latency
    - Operational complexity
    - System coupling
    - Resource usage

### `Why It Exists`

- To set clear expectations around message reliability
    
- To guide system design and consumer behavior
    
- To handle failures predictably
    
- To choose appropriate trade-offs for different workloads
    
- To avoid false assumptions about message processing
