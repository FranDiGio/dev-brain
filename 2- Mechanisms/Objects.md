### `Definition`

**Objects** organize **data and behavior into a single unit**, allowing programs to model entities that maintain state and perform actions. They provide a structured way to associate operations with the data they act upon.

---
### `How It Works`

An object encapsulates state as stored values and exposes behavior through operations that can read or modify that state.

Objects are created according to rules defined by the programming model, and interactions occur by invoking operations on specific object instances.

State is maintained across these interactions, allowing objects to represent ongoing entities within a program.

### `Why It Exists`

- To group related **data and behavior** together
    
- To model complex entities in a structured way
    
- To promote **encapsulation and organization** of program logic
    
- To support modular and maintainable program design
