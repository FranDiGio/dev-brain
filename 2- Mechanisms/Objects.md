### `Definition`

Objects are units of data and behavior combined into a single entity. They bundle **state** (attributes) and **actions** (methods) to represent real-world or logical concepts within a program.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Contain **attributes** that store data.
    
- Expose **methods** that operate on that data.
    
- Created from **classes** or prototypes depending on the language.
    
- Represent entities with both state and behavior.
