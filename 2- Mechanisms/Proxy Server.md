### `Definition`

A **proxy server** sits **between clients and backend services**, forwarding requests and responses on their behalf. It allows control over how traffic enters, exits, or traverses a system.

---
### `How It Works`

Client requests are first received by the proxy instead of reaching backend services directly.  

The proxy evaluates each request and forwards it to the appropriate destination, optionally modifying, filtering, caching, or rejecting it.

Responses from backend services are returned through the proxy before reaching the client, allowing the same control to be applied in reverse.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To provide **control and visibility** over network traffic
    
- To improve **security** by isolating backend services
    
- To optimize **performance** through caching or request handling
    
- To support flexible **traffic routing and system boundaries**
