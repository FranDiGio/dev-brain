### `Definition`

**Assembly languages** are a **mechanism for expressing machine-level operations** using human-readable symbols, enabling direct control over how instructions are executed by the CPU.

They provide a structured way to map human intent to processor instructions with minimal abstraction.

### `How It Works`

Program logic is written using **mnemonics** that correspond directly to CPU instructions.  
Each instruction specifies operations on registers, memory addresses, or control flow, and is translated into binary machine code through a one-to-one mapping defined by the processor’s instruction set.

Execution behavior is tightly coupled to the underlying hardware architecture.

### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **precise control over hardware behavior**
    
- To allow **low-level optimization** of performance and resource usage
    
- To provide a human-readable representation of **machine code**
    
- To support systems where higher-level abstractions are unavailable or inefficient
