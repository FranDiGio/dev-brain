### `Definition`

A **commit** is a **mechanism for recording a snapshot of changes** in a version control system, capturing a deliberate state of the codebase at a specific point in time.

It represents an intentional unit of progress within a project’s history.

---
### `How It Works`

When changes are committed, the current state of selected files is recorded along with metadata such as author, timestamp, and a descriptive message.  
This snapshot becomes a new entry in the repository’s history and can be referenced, compared, or restored later.

Commits are created within a branch and form a chronological sequence that tracks the evolution of the codebase.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To provide **traceable progress** over time
    
- To group related changes into **meaningful units**
    
- To enable **collaboration, review, and rollback**
    
- To support **history-based reasoning** and debugging
