### `Definition`

A **commit** is a recorded snapshot of changes in a version control system. It represents a deliberate point in time where a developer saves a set of changes along with a message explaining what was done.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Atomic Change Unit:**  
    A commit groups related changes into a single, logical unit.
    
- **Permanent History Entry:**  
    Once created, a commit becomes part of the project’s history and can be referenced or restored.
    
- **Requires Intent:**  
    Committing signals that the developer considers the changes stable for the current context.
    
- **Identified by Metadata:**  
    Each commit includes an author, timestamp, unique hash, and message.
    
- **Foundation for Collaboration:**  
    Commits allow others to review progress, understand decisions, and debug issues.
    
- **Branch-Specific:**  
    Commits belong to a branch until merged elsewhere.
