### `Definition`

**Branching** is a **control-flow mechanism** that enables a program to **select and execute different execution paths** based on evaluated conditions.

It allows software to respond dynamically to data, state, or input.

---
### `How It Works`

During execution, a condition is evaluated using Boolean logic. 

Based on the result, control flow is redirected to one of multiple possible code paths, while non-selected paths are skipped.

This decision point alters the linear flow of execution and determines which instructions run next.

### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **decision-making** in programs
    
- To allow behavior to change based on **state or input**
    
- To support **conditional logic** and rule-based execution
    
- To form the foundation of **program control flow**
