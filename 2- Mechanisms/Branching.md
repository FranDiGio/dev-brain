### `Definition`

**Branching** is the mechanism by which a program **diverges execution into different paths** based on evaluated conditions.

---
### `How It Works`

- A condition is evaluated at runtime.
    
- Based on the result, execution jumps to **one of multiple possible paths**.
    
- Only one branch executes for a given evaluation.
    
- Branching is triggered by conditional constructs such as:
    
    - `if / else`
    - `switch / case`
    
- Once a branch completes, execution continues from a defined join point or exits the structure.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To allow programs to **adapt behavior dynamically**.
    
- To support alternative logic paths without duplicating code.
    
- To structure decision-based logic clearly and predictably.
    
- To enable expressive, readable program flow.
    
- To form the backbone of conditional execution in all programs.
