### `Definition`

A **fork** creates an **independent copy of a repository under a separate ownership context**, allowing changes to be made without directly affecting the original source. It enables parallel development and contribution across organizational or ownership boundaries.

---
### `How It Works`

A new repository is created by duplicating the state and history of an existing repository, but assigning it to a different owner. 

The fork evolves independently, while optionally maintaining a relationship with the original repository to synchronize updates or propose changes back.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **safe experimentation** without modifying the original repository
    
- To support **external contribution** to shared or open-source projects
    
- To allow development under **separate ownership or permissions**
    
- To facilitate collaboration across organizational boundaries
