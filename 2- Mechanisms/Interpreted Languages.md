### `Definition`

An **interpreted language** follows an execution approach where source code is **processed and executed at runtime**, rather than being fully translated into machine code beforehand.

Program behavior is determined dynamically as instructions are evaluated during execution.

---
### `How It Works`

Source code is read and analyzed during program execution.  

Instructions are evaluated and executed incrementally, with program state updated as each step runs.

This runtime processing relies on an execution environment that manages control flow, data handling, and interaction with system resources as the program progresses.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **rapid iteration and experimentation**
    
- To reduce upfront translation steps during development
    
- To support **dynamic behavior** and flexible program execution
    
- To allow programs to run across environments that share a compatible execution model
