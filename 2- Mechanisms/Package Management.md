### `Definition`

**Package management** describes how software components are **retrieved, installed, updated, configured, and removed** in a controlled and repeatable way.

It governs how systems and projects manage external software dependencies over time.

---
### `How It Works`

Software components are distributed through repositories or registries and identified by names and versions.  

A package management process retrieves selected components, resolves their dependencies, and installs them into a target environment.

This process applies both at the operating system level for system software and at the language or project level for application dependencies.
