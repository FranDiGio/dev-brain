### `Definition`

A **merge** is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another in a version control system. It combines different lines of development into a single, unified history.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Integrates Branches:**  
    Brings committed changes from a source branch into a target branch (often `main`).
    
- **Preserves History:**  
    Maintains the development history of both branches.
    
- **May Introduce Conflicts:**  
    If the same code was changed differently, manual resolution is required.
    
- **Typically Follows Review:**  
    In team workflows, merges usually happen after a pull request is approved.
    
- **Marks Completion:**  
    Signals that a feature or fix is ready to be part of the main codebase.
