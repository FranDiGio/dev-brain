### `Definition`

A **merge** integrates changes from one line of development into another, combining separate histories into a single codebase state. It enables independently developed changes to become part of a shared evolution.

---
### `How It Works`

Changes from a source branch are compared against a target branch and applied to it.  
If the changes affect different parts of the codebase, they can be integrated automatically.  

When overlapping changes exist, conflicts arise and must be resolved before integration completes.

The resulting state reflects contributions from both development lines.

### `Why It Exists`

- To **combine parallel work** into a unified codebase
    
- To support **collaboration across branches**
    
- To preserve development history while integrating changes
    
- To signal completion of isolated development efforts
