### `Definition`

A **branch** is an independent line of development within a version control system that allows changes to be made without affecting other work. Each branch represents a snapshot of the codebase that can evolve separately and later be merged.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Isolated Development:**  
    Changes made in a branch do not affect other branches until merged.
    
- **Starts from an Existing State:**  
    A new branch begins as an exact copy of another branch at a point in time.
    
- **Supports Parallel Work:**  
    Multiple branches can be worked on simultaneously for features, fixes, or experiments.
    
- **Temporary or Long-Lived:**  
    Branches may exist briefly for a task or persist for ongoing development.
    
- **Core to Collaboration:**  
    Enables multiple developers to work safely on the same codebase.
    
- **Tool-Agnostic Concept:**  
    Exists in Git and other version control systems, not specific to GitHub.
