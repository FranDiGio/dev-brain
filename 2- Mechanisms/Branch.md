### `Definition`

A **branch** is a **mechanism for isolating and evolving changes** within a version control system by creating an independent line of development from an existing state of the codebase.

It enables parallel modification of code without immediately affecting other work.

---
### `How It Works`

A branch is created as a reference to a specific snapshot of the repository at a given point in time.  
Subsequent changes are recorded independently on that branch, allowing it to diverge from its origin until changes are intentionally combined through merging.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **parallel development** on the same codebase
    
- To isolate changes and reduce the risk of conflicts
    
- To support experimentation, feature development, and fixes
    
- To facilitate collaboration among multiple contributors
