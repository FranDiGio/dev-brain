### `Definition`

**Virtualization** enables **multiple isolated computing environments** to run on shared physical hardware by abstracting underlying resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and networking.

It allows systems to operate independently while sharing the same physical host.

---
### `How It Works`

Hardware resources are abstracted and presented as virtualized units that can be allocated to separate execution environments.

Each environment operates as if it has dedicated hardware, while a control layer coordinates access to the shared physical resources.

This abstraction ensures isolation between environments while dynamically managing resource usage.

### `Why It Exists`

- To improve **hardware utilization and efficiency**
    
- To enable **isolation** between workloads on the same machine
    
- To support **scalable and flexible infrastructure provisioning**
    
- To simplify deployment, migration, and management of systems
