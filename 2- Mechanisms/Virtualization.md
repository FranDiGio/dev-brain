### `Definition`

**Virtualization** is the process of creating **virtual versions of computing resources** — such as servers, networks, or storage — so multiple isolated systems can run on a single physical machine.  
It abstracts hardware to allow greater flexibility, scalability, and resource efficiency.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Abstraction layer** → Hardware is decoupled from software, letting multiple virtual environments share one physical host.
    
- **Hypervisor-managed** → The hypervisor allocates CPU, memory, and storage to each virtual machine (VM).
    
- **Types of virtualization** → Includes **server**, **storage**, **network**, and **desktop** virtualization.
    
- **Isolation** → Each VM runs independently, preventing interference and improving fault tolerance.
    
- **Foundation for cloud computing** → Enables Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and modern data center efficiency.
    
- **Evolution path** → Virtualization led to **containers**, which offer even lighter isolation.
