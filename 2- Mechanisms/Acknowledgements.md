### `Definition`

**Acknowledgements** define how and when a consumer **confirms successful processing of a message** to the messaging system.

They determine whether a message is considered completed, retried, or redelivered.

### `How It Works`

- A message is delivered to a consumer.
    
- After processing:
    
    - The consumer sends an **acknowledgement** to the messaging system.
    
- If an acknowledgement is received:
    
    - The message is marked as successfully processed.
    
- If no acknowledgement is received (e.g. crash, timeout):
    
    - The message may be redelivered or retried.

**Acknowledgements can be:**

- Automatic (ack on receipt)
- Manual (ack after successful processing)
- Explicitly rejected (negative acknowledgement)

### `Why It Exists`

- To confirm message processing success
    
- To enable retries and redelivery on failure
    
- To prevent silent message loss
    
- To support delivery guarantees
    
- To coordinate reliable message handling in distributed systems
