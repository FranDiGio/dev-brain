### `Key Ideas`

- Built on top of a **display server** (X11, Wayland on Linux).
    
- Includes:
    
    - **Window Manager** (tiling/stacking/compositing)
    - **Panels & Dock**
    - **Application Launcher**
    - **File Manager**
    - **System Settings**
    - **Bundled Applications** (editors, terminal emulators, etc.)
    
- Defines the **look and feel** of the OS experience.
    
- Linux has many DEs (GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE, Cinnamon).
    
- Windows and macOS have tightly integrated DEs (not user-replaceable).
    
- Provides accessibility and system integration features.
    
- Heavier than standalone window managers, but more user-friendly.
