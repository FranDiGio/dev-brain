### `Definition`

A **pull request (PR)** provides a structured way to **propose integrating changes** from one line of development into another while enabling review and discussion before integration. It introduces a controlled checkpoint between independent work and shared code.

---
### `How It Works`

Changes committed on a source branch are presented for comparison against a target branch.  
Reviewers can inspect the differences, comment, request modifications, or approve the proposal.

Once approved, the changes can be integrated, completing the transition from isolated development to shared history.

### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **collaborative review** of proposed changes
    
- To improve **code quality and correctness** before integration
    
- To protect stable branches from unvetted changes
    
- To create a visible record of discussion and decision-making
