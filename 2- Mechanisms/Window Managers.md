### `How It Works`

The window manager receives events related to window creation, focus changes, and user input.  

Based on its rules, it determines how windows are placed, resized, layered, or arranged, and applies visual decorations or transitions as needed.

It operates in user space and coordinates with the display system to reflect window state changes on screen.
