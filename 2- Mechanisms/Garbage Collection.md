### `Definition`

**Garbage collection** is the process by which a runtime system **automatically reclaims memory** that is no longer reachable or needed by a program, preventing memory leaks and reducing manual memory management.

---
### `How It Works`

- The runtime tracks **object references** created during execution.
    
- Objects that are **no longer reachable** from active references are identified as garbage.
    
- A collection cycle reclaims the memory used by those objects.
    
- Common strategies include:
    
    - tracing reachability from roots (e.g., stack, globals)
    - periodic or incremental collection
    
- Collection may pause execution briefly or run concurrently, depending on the system.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To **simplify memory management** for developers.
    
- To **prevent memory leaks** and dangling references.
    
- To improve **program safety and reliability**.
    
- To enable higher-level programming models without explicit deallocation.
    
- To manage memory efficiently in long-running applications.
