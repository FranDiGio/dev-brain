### `Definition`

**Memory management** governs how a system **allocates, tracks, protects, and reclaims memory** for running programs. It ensures that memory is used efficiently while maintaining isolation and stability between concurrent workloads.

---
### `How It Works`

When programs run, memory management assigns regions of memory for code, data, and execution state.  

These regions are mapped into each process’s address space and tracked so they can be accessed safely and independently.

The system controls how memory is allocated, shared, paged, and released, handling situations such as memory exhaustion, reuse, and protection violations.

### `Why It Exists`

- To enable **safe and isolated execution** of multiple programs
    
- To manage **limited physical memory resources** efficiently
    
- To provide programs with a consistent view of memory
    
- To prevent accidental or malicious interference between processes
    
- To support stable system operation over time
