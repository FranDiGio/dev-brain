- **Network Segmentation:**  
    Separates public-facing components from internal services and databases.
    
- **Rule-Based Control:**  
    Enforces policies on what traffic is permitted across network boundaries.
    
- **Critical in Production:**  
    Especially important for systems exposed to the internet.
