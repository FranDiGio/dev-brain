### `Definition`

A **firewall** is a security component that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks.

---
### `How It Works`

Network traffic is inspected as it enters or leaves a network boundary. Traffic is evaluated against a set of rules based on attributes such as source, destination, protocol, or port, and is either permitted or denied accordingly.

This evaluation occurs transparently as data flows between network segments.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To **protect systems** from unauthorized or malicious network access
    
- To enforce **network-level security policies**
    
- To isolate internal components from external exposure
    
- To reduce the attack surface of production systems
