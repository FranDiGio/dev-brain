### `Definition`

An **application server** is a **system mechanism** responsible for **executing server-side application logic** and coordinating interactions between clients, infrastructure services, and data stores.

It enables applications to separate **business behavior** from presentation and persistence concerns.

---
### `How It Works`

Client requests are received (directly or via a web server) and routed to application logic managed by the application server. 

The mechanism executes business rules, orchestrates workflows, manages application state, and interacts with external resources such as databases or messaging systems before returning results.

---
### `Why It Exists`

- To **centralize business logic** outside of clients and databases
    
- To enable **scalable, maintainable server-side execution**
    
- To separate **application behavior** from request handling and data storage
    
- To support **stateful interactions, transactions, and coordination** across system components
