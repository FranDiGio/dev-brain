### `Definition`

A **software stack** is a **collection of technologies, tools, and frameworks** that work together to develop and run an application. It defines the **layers of an application’s ecosystem**, from the user interface to the backend services and underlying infrastructure.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Layered Structure:**  
    Software stacks organize technologies into layers, typically including:
    
    - **Frontend:** Handles user interaction (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
        
    - **Backend:** Manages business logic and APIs (e.g., Node.js, Django, Spring Boot).
        
    - **Database:** Stores and retrieves persistent data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
        
    - **Infrastructure & Runtime:** Provides hosting, OS, and environment (e.g., Docker, Linux, AWS).
    
- **Stack Models:**  
    Common examples include **LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)**, **MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js)**, and **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.
    
- **Integration & Interchangeability:**  
    Each layer communicates through APIs or protocols.  
    Components can often be swapped to fit performance or scalability needs.
    
- **Purpose of a Stack:**  
    Defines a standardized combination of technologies that simplify setup, improve collaboration, and ensure environment consistency across development, testing, and deployment.
