#### `What was explained`

- Is the process of deploying to production-like environments when is safe to do so.
- CD always comes after CI, as the master branch should always be deployable.
- The principles of CD are
	1- **Build quality in** -> It uses CI/CD pipelines to have rigorous checks and make sure the code is of quality and builds won't fail
	2- **Working in small batches** -> smaller changes are easier to test and present less risk
	3- **Computers perform repetition, people solve problems** -> best to automate repetitive tasks and leave all the problem solving to the people
	4- **Pursue Continuous Improvement** -> actionable measurements on what to improve
	5- **Everyone is responsible** -> broken builds hold back everyone so its everyone's responsibility to help fix it

- The concept of Continuous Deployment is different from Continuous Delivery
	- **Continuous Deployment** -> this term is reserved for promoting deployment to production: on-prem, public cloud, or hybrid cloud.

#### `Why it matters`

- Its the way of DevOps to manage risk, by pushing many small changes to production as teams get used to it and if problems arise they don't have to check all corners of a massive big patch.
