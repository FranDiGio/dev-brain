#### `What was explained`

- Is the way of working since the industrial revolution as putting people in specific roles was faster than tooling them up differently for each step of the process.
- Its the idea of working in silos as people would be more efficient and master their part of the job
- This framework or concept was designed for factory work, not software development.
- This also reflects how SE is treated as Civil Engineering (CE), where you build the thing and throw it to the next team and move on.
- Software is meant to be patched, and improved, and maintained. You don't randomly add a new floor to a building, but you can add a new feature later down the line for software.
- Treat software as a product, not a project with end date.

#### `Why it matters`

- It does not work or translate for how software development works. SE is bespoke, i.e. we sometimes don't even assemble from things that already exist, we create them.
- It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do
- Handoffs created by working in silos leads to bottlenecks, mistakes and delays (waterfall).
