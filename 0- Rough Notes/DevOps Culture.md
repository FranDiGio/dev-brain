#### `What was explained`

- Devs want innovation, while Ops want stability.
- You need shared owner-ship so nobody takes the full blame when things go wrong or the full credit when things go right.
- Building DevOps culture comes from setting aside the apathy and having common metrics, collaboration, and embracing change.
- Introducing DevOps into an organization is hard, there is cases of companies introducing self-service in the cloud for devs, but then they'll put a ticket queue in front of it (ServiceNow haha) so Ops can do it for them (this defeats the whole purpose).
- Enterprises see change as complex, high risk, and time-consuming, whereas DevOps tries to break big projects in small manageable changes.
