### `Definition`

**ANSI SQL** is the formal standard that defines the syntax, semantics, and core features of the SQL language. It establishes a common specification that database systems can implement to ensure consistent and predictable behavior.

---
### `Purpose`

- **Interoperability**  
    Provides a shared foundation so SQL-based systems follow common rules.
    
- **Portability**  
    Enables queries and schemas to be transferred across compliant database systems with minimal changes.
    
- **Language Consistency**  
    Defines standard grammar, data types, constraints, and transaction behavior.
    
- **Vendor Alignment**  
    Serves as a baseline that vendors can extend while maintaining core compatibility.

---
### `Structure`

- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**  
    Defines schema objects such as tables and constraints.
    
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**  
    Specifies operations for querying and modifying data.
    
- **Transaction Control**  
    Defines commit, rollback, and isolation behavior.
    
- **Constraint & Integrity Rules**  
    Establishes rules for keys, references, and data validity.
    
- **Incremental Revisions**  
    Updated periodically (e.g., SQL-92, SQL:1999, SQL:2011) to expand capabilities.
