## `Definition`

**Waterfall** is a **linear software development methodology** where progress flows through fixed stages — requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance — in sequence.

Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, emphasizing documentation and upfront planning.

---
## `Key Ideas`

- Waterfall treats software development as a **predictable, step-by-step process**, ideal for projects with stable requirements and clearly defined outcomes.  
	
- It ensures traceability and control through heavy documentation but struggles with adaptability in dynamic environments.  
	
- In modern practice, Waterfall remains useful in **regulated or low-uncertainty domains**, though it’s largely replaced by **Agile** and **DevOps** approaches for most software projects.


---
## `Challenges`

- **Rigid structure** → adapting to new requirements mid-project is difficult and costly.
	
- **Late feedback loop** → user testing occurs only after full implementation, limiting early validation.
	
- **Risk accumulation** → problems surface late, often requiring major rework.
	
- **Poor innovation fit** → unsuitable for iterative experimentation or fast-changing markets.
