### `Definition`

**Extreme Programming (XP)** is an **Agile software development methodology** that emphasizes **high-quality code, continuous feedback, and close collaboration** between developers and customers.

It aims to improve responsiveness to changing requirements through short cycles, frequent releases, and technical excellence.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Short Iterations & Continuous Feedback:**  
    Development happens in very small cycles (often 1–2 weeks) with constant client feedback.
    
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**  
    Write tests _before_ code to ensure correctness and maintainability.
    
- **Pair Programming:**  
    Two developers work together at one workstation — one writes code, the other reviews in real time.
    
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**  
    Code is integrated and tested frequently (multiple times a day) to detect issues early.
    
- **Refactoring:**  
    Regularly improve existing code structure without changing behavior to keep it clean and adaptable.
    
- **Collective Code Ownership:**  
    Every team member can modify any part of the codebase, encouraging collaboration and shared responsibility.
    
- **Sustainable Pace:**  
    Teams maintain a consistent, non-excessive workload to avoid burnout and ensure long-term productivity.

### `Challenges`

- **High Discipline Required:**  
    XP demands constant testing, refactoring, and communication — hard to sustain without strong team culture.
    
- **Customer Availability:**  
    Relies heavily on continuous client feedback; unsuitable when stakeholders are not consistently involved.
    
- **Scalability Issues:**  
    Works best for small to medium teams with frequent communication; large enterprises may struggle to adopt it fully.
