### `Definition`

**Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture** is a decentralized architectural pattern where each node in the system acts as both a **client and a server**, enabling direct communication without a central coordinator.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Decentralized Network:**  
    No single server controls the system.  
    _Increases resilience and eliminates single points of failure._
    
- **Each Node Is Equal:**  
    Nodes request and provide resources/services to each other.  
    _Used in distributed networks like file sharing and blockchain._
    
- **Scales Naturally:**  
    More users → more resources added to the network.  
    _Highly scalable for shared workloads._
    
- **Fault Tolerance Through Distribution:**  
    Data or workload is replicated across nodes.  
    _System remains operational even if some nodes fail._
    
- **Applications Include:**  
    File-sharing networks (BitTorrent), cryptocurrency networks, decentralized applications, collaborative systems.

### `Challenges`

- Harder to secure due to lack of a central authority.
    
- Trust management and verification are complex.
    
- Performance can vary based on node quality.
    
- Coordination and consensus (in some systems) can introduce overhead.
    
- Harder to enforce consistency across peers.
