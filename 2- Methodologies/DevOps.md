## `Definition`

**DevOps** (short for _Development and Operations_) is a cultural and technical movement that extends Agile principles to the entire software delivery lifecycle. It is the practice of development and operation engineers working together during the entire development lifecycle, following Lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver software in a rapid and continuous manner.

## `Key Ideas`

- **Breaking silos** → Dev and Ops working together instead of separately.
	
- **Fail fast, recover fast** → embrace experimentation with quick rollback strategies.
	
- **Continuous feedback** → testing in real environments (e.g., A/B testing) rather than relying only on analysis.
	
- **Culture first** → tools support DevOps, but real success comes from openness, trust, and communication.
	
- **Automation** → infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring at scale.

## `Challenges`

- **Cultural transformation** → The hardest part of DevOps isn’t tools, but mindset. Teams used to working in silos often resist shared ownership, transparency, and continuous change.

- **Legacy systems and architectures** → Older monolithic applications or rigid infrastructures can’t easily support iterative deployment or automation.

- **Tooling complexity** → Integrating CI/CD, monitoring, and infrastructure-as-code tools across environments introduces steep learning curves and maintenance overhead.

- **Balancing speed with stability** → Continuous delivery pressures can lead to rushed changes unless testing, observability, and rollback mechanisms are robust.

- **Measuring success** → Without clear metrics (e.g., deployment frequency, mean time to recovery), cultural progress and delivery improvements are difficult to track.
