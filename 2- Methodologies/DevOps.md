## `Definition`

**DevOps** (short for _Development and Operations_) is a cultural and technical movement that extends Agile principles to the entire software delivery lifecycle. DevOps is the practice of development and operation engineers working together during the entire development lifecycle, following Lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver software in a rapid and continuous manner.

---
## `Key Ideas`

- **Breaking silos** → Dev and Ops working together instead of separately.
- **Fail fast, recover fast** → embrace experimentation with quick rollback strategies.
- **Continuous feedback** → testing in real environments (e.g., A/B testing) rather than relying only on analysis.
- **Culture first** → tools support DevOps, but real success comes from openness, trust, and communication.
- **Automation** → infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring at scale.

---
## `Requires`

- A cultural shift in mindset and collaboration.
- Modern application design that supports iteration and resilience.
- Leveraging automation across build, test, deploy, and monitoring.
- A programmable platform enabling **continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)**.
