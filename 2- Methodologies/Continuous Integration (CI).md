## `Definition`

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a **software development methodology** where developers frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository. 

Each integration triggers an **automated build and test process**, ensuring the codebase remains functional and stable. The goal is to detect errors early, reduce merge conflicts, and maintain a deployable codebase at all times.

---
## `Key Ideas`

- **Frequent integrations** → Developers commit small, incremental changes to the main branch multiple times per day.
    
- **Automated builds and tests** → Every commit triggers automated compilation, testing, and validation steps to catch issues early.
    
- **Single source of truth** → The main branch reflects the current working state of the product; broken builds must be fixed immediately.
    
- **Fast feedback** → Immediate test results help developers identify and resolve issues before they compound.
    
- **Foundation for CD** → CI ensures the code is _always ready to deploy_, but deployment itself (to staging or production) happens in **Continuous Delivery (CD)**.
    
- **Cultural alignment** → Encourages collaboration, accountability, and shared responsibility for quality across the team.


---
## `Challenges`

- **Misunderstanding CI vs CD** → CI focuses on integrating and testing code; CD extends that to automated deployments.
    
- **Flaky or slow tests** → Inefficient test suites can slow feedback loops and discourage frequent commits.
    
- **Complex merges** → Even with CI, poor branching strategies or large commits can still cause conflicts.
    
- **Tooling setup** → Implementing reliable pipelines requires consistent environments and robust automation.
