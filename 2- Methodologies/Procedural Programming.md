### `Definition`

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into procedures or functions that operate on data. Programs are written as a sequence of steps executed in order.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Programs are structured around **procedures** (functions).
    
- Emphasizes **step-by-step execution**.
    
- Data is often stored in variables and passed into procedures.
    
- Control flow (conditionals, loops) drives program behavior.
    
- Common in languages like C, early Python, and early JavaScript.

---
### `Challenges`

- Can lead to **scattered logic** as projects grow.
    
- Harder to model **real-world entities** directly.
    
- Shared, global state can make large systems difficult to maintain.
    
- Not ideal for systems requiring strong modularity or extensibility.
