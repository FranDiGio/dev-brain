## `Summary`

**Agile** is a **software development methodology and mindset** focused on delivering value through **iteration, collaboration, and adaptability**. It emphasizes responding to change, continuous improvement, and delivering working software frequently instead of following rigid, pre-defined plans.

## `Explanation`

Agile emerged in the early 2000s as a reaction to the limitations of traditional, plan-driven approaches like Waterfall. It is guided by the **Agile Manifesto**, which values:

1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**  
    People and communication drive progress more than strict adherence to tools or methodologies. Agile teams emphasize collaboration, trust, and shared understanding.
    
2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation**  
    The primary measure of progress is running, functional software — not stacks of plans or specifications. Documentation still matters, but only as long as it adds value.
    
3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**  
    Agile promotes ongoing cooperation with customers instead of rigidly sticking to pre-agreed terms. The goal is to adapt to real needs as they emerge.
    
4. **Responding to change over following a plan**  
    Plans are useful, but Agile teams expect change and treat it as an opportunity to improve, not a failure to plan. Flexibility is built into the process.

Agile is not a single method — it’s a **set of principles** that inform frameworks such as [[Scrum]], [[Kanban]], and [[Extreme Programming (XP)]].

Teams working in Agile cycles deliver small, usable increments of software, gather feedback early, and adapt continuously. This promotes faster learning, reduces waste, and keeps projects aligned with user needs.

Agile also promotes **cross-functional teams**, **self-organization**, and **transparency**, which help create a culture of trust and accountability — principles that later evolved further in DevOps.

## `Limitations`

- Misinterpreting “no documentation” as “no structure.”
- Using “responding to change” as an excuse for poor planning.
- Focusing on rituals (e.g., daily standups) instead of values.
- Assuming Agile is a fixed method rather than a mindset.
