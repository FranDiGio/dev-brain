### `Definition`

**Scrum** is an **Agile framework for managing and delivering complex projects** through short, iterative cycles called **sprints**.  It emphasizes teamwork, transparency, and continuous feedback to produce working software incrementally.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Sprints:**  
    Timeboxed iterations (usually 1–4 weeks) where the team delivers a usable product increment.
    
- **Roles:**
    
    - **Product Owner:** Prioritizes and manages the product backlog.
    - **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the process, removes blockers, and ensures adherence to Scrum principles.
    - **Development Team:** Self-organizing group that executes sprint work.
    
- **Events (Ceremonies):**
    
    - **Daily Stand-Up:** 15-minute check-in to share progress, plans, and blockers.
    - **Sprint Planning:** Define sprint goals and select backlog items.
    - **Sprint Review:** Demonstrate completed work and gather feedback.
    - **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflect on the process and identify improvements.
    
- **Artifacts:**
    
    - **Product Backlog:** Ordered list of features, bugs, and tasks.
    - **Sprint Backlog:** Subset of items selected for the current sprint.
    - **Increment:** The working, potentially shippable product result.

### `Challenges`

- **Role Confusion:**  
    Misunderstanding or overlapping of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developer responsibilities weakens accountability.
    
- **Scope Creep:**  
    Frequent backlog changes or unclear priorities disrupt sprint focus and delivery rhythm.
    
- **Over-Formalization:**  
    Treating Scrum as rigid or bureaucratic instead of an adaptive framework defeats its purpose.
    
- **Poor Sprint Discipline:**  
    Teams skipping retrospectives, reviews, or failing to timebox sprints lose transparency and rhythm.
    
- **Stakeholder Misalignment:**  
    Lack of engagement or unrealistic expectations from stakeholders reduces feedback quality.
    
- **Team Immaturity:**  
    Inexperienced teams may struggle with self-organization, estimating effort, or adhering to Agile values.
