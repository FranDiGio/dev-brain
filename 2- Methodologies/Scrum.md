### `Key Ideas`

- **Sprints:**  
    Timeboxed iterations (usually 1–4 weeks) where the team delivers a usable product increment.
    
- **Roles:**
    
    - **Product Owner:** Prioritizes and manages the product backlog.
    - **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the process, removes blockers, and ensures adherence to Scrum principles.
    - **Development Team:** Self-organizing group that executes sprint work.
    
- **Events (Ceremonies):**
    
    - **Daily Stand-Up:** 15-minute check-in to share progress, plans, and blockers.
    - **Sprint Planning:** Define sprint goals and select backlog items.
    - **Sprint Review:** Demonstrate completed work and gather feedback.
    - **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflect on the process and identify improvements.
    
- **Artifacts:**
    
    - **Product Backlog:** Ordered list of features, bugs, and tasks.
    - **Sprint Backlog:** Subset of items selected for the current sprint.
    - **Increment:** The working, potentially shippable product result.
