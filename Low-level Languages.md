### `Definition`

**Low-level programming languages** provide **little to no abstraction from hardware**. They give developers **direct control over system resources**, memory, and processor instructions.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Direct Hardware Interaction:**  
    Code written in low-level languages translates **almost one-to-one** to machine instructions, allowing precise control over CPU and memory.
    
- **Types:**
    
    - **Machine Code:** Binary instructions executed directly by the CPU.
        
    - **Assembly Language:** Symbolic representation of machine instructions using mnemonics like `ADD`, `MOV`, `JMP`.
    
- **Performance and Complexity:**
    
    - **Advantages:** Extremely fast and efficient; ideal for embedded or system-level programming.
        
    - **Disadvantages:** Harder to read, write, and debug; highly platform-specific.
    
- **Translation Process:**  
    Assembly languages use an **assembler**, not a compiler or interpreter, to convert symbolic code into machine code.
    
- **Examples:**  
    x86 Assembly, ARM Assembly, MIPS Assembly, Machine Code.
