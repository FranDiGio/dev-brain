### `Definition`

A **library** is a **collection of pre-written code** that provides reusable functions, classes, or utilities developers can call to perform common tasks without reinventing them.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Reusable Building Blocks:**  
    Libraries focus on solving _specific problems_ (e.g., DOM manipulation, data visualization, HTTP requests).  
    They’re imported and invoked _within_ a developer’s own code.
    
- **Control Flow:**  
    In a library, **you control the flow** — your application code calls the library functions when needed.
    
- **Granularity:**  
    Libraries tend to be lightweight and modular, often focused on a single domain (e.g., Lodash for utilities, Axios for HTTP).

### `Use Cases`

- Handling HTTP requests (Axios, Requests)
- Data manipulation (Lodash, Pandas)
- UI components (React component libraries, Material UI)
- Encryption and hashing (Crypto libraries)
- Mathematical or scientific computation (NumPy, Math.js)
