### `Definition`

The **Application Layer (Layer 7)** of the **OSI Model** defines the **interface between the network and end-user applications**.  
It provides protocols and services that enable software applications to **communicate over a network**, handling user-level data exchange and resource access.

---
### `Purpose`

- Serves as the **entry and exit point** for user interactions with networked systems.
    
- Provides **application-specific protocols** for tasks like web browsing, email, and file transfer.
    
- Handles **resource sharing**, **service discovery**, and **network transparency** for applications.
    
- Manages **user authentication**, **data integrity**, and **session context** at the application level.
    
- Translates user actions into network operations (e.g., “Send email” → SMTP request).

### `Structure`

|Aspect|Function|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|**Application Protocols**|Define rules for specific services.|HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS, SNMP|
|**Resource Access**|Interfaces with files, directories, and network resources.|Web APIs, NFS|
|**User Services**|Delivers network services directly to end applications.|Email clients, browsers|
|**Authentication / Control**|Manages credentials and permissions at application level.|OAuth, Kerberos|
|**Data Unit**|_Data_ (as seen by the application)|–|

**Devices / Components:** Application servers, clients, web browsers, mail servers.
