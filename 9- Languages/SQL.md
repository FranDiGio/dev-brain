### `Definition`

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a declarative language used to define, query, and manipulate data in relational database systems. It is primarily used to interact with data structured according to the relational model.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Declarative Design**  
    Users specify _what_ data they want, not the procedural steps to retrieve it.
    
- **Set-Based Semantics**  
    Operations apply to sets of rows rather than individual records.
    
- **Data Definition & Manipulation**  
    Includes Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL).
    
- **Constraint Enforcement**  
    Supports primary keys, foreign keys, and other integrity constraints.
    
- **Standardized Core**  
    Defined by formal standards (see ANSI SQL), though implementations often extend it.
    
- **Model-Specific Language**  
    Designed around the Relational Model.

### `Use Cases`

- Querying structured relational data
    
- Defining database schemas and constraints
    
- Managing transactions
    
- Powering backend applications
    
- Performing analytical queries and aggregations
