### `Definition`

**MongoDB Query Language (MQL)** is the query language used to interact with data stored under the document model in MongoDB.

It is primarily used to retrieve, insert, update, and aggregate JSON-like documents.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Document-Oriented Syntax**  
    Queries are expressed using structured key-value objects that mirror document structure.
    
- **Flexible Schema Interaction**  
    Supports dynamic fields and nested data without requiring predefined schemas.
    
- **Filter-Based Querying**  
    Queries specify matching conditions using field-value patterns rather than relational joins.
    
- **Aggregation Framework**  
    Provides pipeline-based operations for transforming and analyzing document data.
    
- **Model-Coupled Design**  
    Designed specifically around the Document Model rather than relational tables.
