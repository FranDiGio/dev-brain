### `Definition`

**Cypher** is a declarative query language used to interact with data structured under the graph model. It is primarily used to query, create, and traverse relationships between nodes in graph databases.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Pattern-Matching Syntax**  
    Queries are written by describing graph patterns (nodes and relationships) to match.
    
- **Relationship-Centric Design**  
    Optimized for expressing connections and traversals rather than joins.
    
- **Declarative Approach**  
    Users specify the pattern of data they want, not the traversal algorithm.
    
- **Graph Abstractions**  
    Uses nodes, relationships, labels, and properties as core primitives.
    
- **Model-Coupled Language**  
    Designed specifically for the Graph Model.

### `Use Cases`

- Querying interconnected data such as social networks
    
- Exploring relationship paths and dependencies
    
- Fraud detection and network analysis
    
- Recommendation systems based on graph traversal
