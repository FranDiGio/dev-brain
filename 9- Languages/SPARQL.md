### `Definition`

**SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)** is a declarative query language used to retrieve and manipulate data structured under the RDF-based graph model. It is primarily used to query semantic and linked data represented as triples.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Triple-Based Querying**  
    SPARQL operates on data structured as subject–predicate–object triples.
    
- **Pattern Matching**  
    Queries specify graph patterns that match relationships between entities.
    
- **Semantic Web Orientation**  
    Designed for querying RDF datasets and linked data environments.
    
- **Declarative Structure**  
    Users describe patterns of data to retrieve rather than traversal algorithms.
    
- **Standardized Language**  
    Defined by a formal specification maintained by the W3C.

### `Use Cases`

- Querying semantic knowledge graphs
    
- Working with linked open data
    
- Ontology-driven data systems
