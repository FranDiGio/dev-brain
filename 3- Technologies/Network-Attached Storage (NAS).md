### `Definition`

**Network Attached Storage (NAS)** is a **storage technology** that provides **centralized file storage** accessible over a network by multiple devices and users.

It allows systems to store and retrieve data as **files** rather than raw blocks, using standard network protocols.

### `Key Ideas`

- **File-Level Storage**  
    NAS operates at the **file level**, exposing shared folders rather than raw disks, making it easy for clients to access data over the network.
    
- **Network-Based Access**  
    Data is accessed via standard protocols such as:
    
    - **NFS**
    - **SMB/CIFS**
    - **AFP** (legacy)  
        enabling cross-platform compatibility.
    
- **Centralized Storage Model**  
    A NAS device acts as a dedicated storage server, simplifying data sharing, backups, and access control.
    
- **Independent Storage Appliance**  
    Typically runs a specialized OS and connects to the network independently of application servers.
    
- **Scales by Capacity**  
    Primarily scales by adding disks or expanding storage pools rather than increasing compute power.
