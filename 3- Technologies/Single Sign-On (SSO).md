### `Key Ideas`

- **Central Authentication Point:**  
    Users authenticate once via a trusted Identity Provider (IdP).
    
- **Federated Identity:**  
    Uses protocols like **SAML** and **OpenID Connect** to exchange authentication data securely.
    
- **Improved Security & UX:**  
    Reduces password fatigue and minimizes weak or reused passwords.
    
- **Session & Token Management:**  
    Employs secure tokens (e.g., JWTs) to authorize users across multiple services.
    
- **Cloud Integration:**  
    Commonly used in Cloud IAM systems and SaaS environments.
