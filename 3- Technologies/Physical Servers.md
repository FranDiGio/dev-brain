## `Definition`

**Physical servers** are dedicated hardware machines that host computing resources directly — CPU, memory, storage, and networking — without a virtualization layer. Each server runs one operating system instance and provides full control over performance, configuration, and security.

---
## `Key Ideas`

- **Dedicated resources** → No shared infrastructure; each application or workload runs on its own hardware.
    
- **Direct control** → Ideal for environments needing custom configurations, predictable performance, or strict compliance.
    
- **Limited scalability** → Scaling up means purchasing and provisioning new machines, making it slower and more expensive than virtualized or cloud systems.
    
- **Maintenance overhead** → Physical servers require manual setup, hardware maintenance, and capacity planning.
    
- **Predecessor to modern infrastructure** → Virtual machines and containers evolved to solve the rigidity and inefficiency of purely physical environments.


---
## `Use Cases`

- **High-performance or latency-sensitive workloads** where direct hardware access is critical (e.g., trading systems, gaming servers).
    
- **Regulated industries** that require dedicated hardware for compliance or data isolation.
    
- **On-premises data centers** where organizations manage their own hardware lifecycle.
