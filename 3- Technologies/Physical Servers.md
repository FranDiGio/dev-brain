### `Definition`

**Physical servers** are **tangible computing machines** that provide processing power, memory, storage, and networking directly through hardware. They represent the **foundation of all computing infrastructure**, serving as the base layer upon which virtual machines, containers, and cloud environments are built.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Hardware-bound resources** → A physical server’s CPU, memory, and disk are fixed and allocated entirely to its operating system — no virtualization layer or resource sharing.
    
- **Single-tenant architecture** → One organization or system owns and manages the entire machine.
    
- **Manual management** → Setup, scaling, and maintenance require direct physical or remote administrative access.
    
- **High reliability and control** → Ideal for environments that require deterministic performance, custom configurations, or tight security control.
    
- **Historical importance** → Physical servers were the dominant model before virtualization and cloud computing introduced flexibility and scalability.

---
### `Use Cases`

- **Data centers and on-premise IT environments** where full control over infrastructure is required.
    
- **Regulated or mission-critical systems** (e.g., banking, defense, medical research) where performance consistency and compliance are key.
    
- **High-performance workloads** such as large-scale computation, simulation, or hardware-level testing.
