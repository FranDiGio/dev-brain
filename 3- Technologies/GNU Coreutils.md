### `Definition`

**GNU Coreutils** is a **collection of fundamental user-space utilities** that provide essential file, text, and process manipulation capabilities on Unix-like operating systems. It supplies the standard command-line tools users and scripts rely on for everyday system interaction.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Core User-Space Utilities**  
    Includes commands such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `chmod`, `chown`, `df`, and many others.
    
- **POSIX-Oriented Behavior**  
    Implements POSIX-defined utilities, often with extended GNU-specific features.
    
- **Foundation for Shell Environments**  
    Forms the backbone of shell usage, scripting, and automation on GNU/Linux systems.
    
- **Separate Programs, Unified Suite**  
    Each command is a separate executable, unlike BusyBox’s single-binary model.
    
- **Feature-Rich Implementations**  
    Prioritizes correctness, completeness, and flexibility over minimal size.
