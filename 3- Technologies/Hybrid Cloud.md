### `Definition`

A **Hybrid Cloud** is a computing environment that combines **public and private clouds** (and sometimes on-premises infrastructure) to share data and applications seamlessly between them.  
It offers organizations the **flexibility** to run workloads where they make the most sense — balancing **control, scalability, and cost efficiency**.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Unified architecture** → Integrates multiple environments (public, private, on-prem) into one cohesive system.
    
- **Workload flexibility** → Sensitive data or legacy apps stay on private/on-prem systems, while scalable workloads run on the public cloud.
    
- **Interoperability** → Uses networking, APIs, and orchestration tools to move data and apps between environments securely.
    
- **Disaster recovery and backup** → Public cloud resources can act as overflow or failover systems for private infrastructure.
    
- **Optimized cost & performance** → Organizations can dynamically choose where to deploy workloads based on resource demand and compliance needs.


**Examples:**

- A company processes data on-prem for compliance but runs analytics or web apps in AWS.
    
- Tools like **Azure Arc**, **AWS Outposts**, and **Google Anthos** enable hybrid deployments.
