### `Definition`

**Bare Metal Servers** are **dedicated physical machines** provided by cloud vendors that allow customers to run workloads **directly on hardware**, without a virtualization layer.  

They offer the **performance, control, and security of physical servers** while maintaining the **scalability and on-demand provisioning** benefits of the cloud.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Full hardware access** → No hypervisor overhead; ideal for workloads requiring maximum performance or isolation.
    
- **Single-tenant** → Each server is dedicated to one customer — no shared resources.
    
- **Custom configurations** → Providers allow custom CPU, memory, storage, and even GPUs for specialized workloads.
    
- **Cloud integration** → Managed through cloud APIs and consoles — combining bare-metal control with cloud flexibility.
    
- **Examples** → AWS Bare Metal Instances, IBM Bare Metal Servers, Oracle Bare Metal Cloud, Equinix Metal.

---
### `Use Cases`

- **High-performance workloads** → AI/ML training, big data analytics, gaming, or scientific computing.
    
- **Regulated environments** → Industries needing strict compliance and data sovereignty.
    
- **Long-term stable workloads** → Dedicated hosting without virtualization management.
    
- **Hybrid cloud setups** → Extend on-prem physical infrastructure into cloud-managed bare metal.
