### `Definition`

**Drivers** are **software components** that allow the operating system to **communicate with and control hardware devices**. They translate generic OS requests into hardware-specific instructions.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Act as the **bridge between hardware and the operating system**.
    
- Encapsulate **device-specific logic**, hiding hardware details from higher system layers.
    
- Operate in **kernel space or privileged context** in most operating systems.
    
- Enable the OS to interact uniformly with different hardware vendors and models.
    
- Closely tied to system stability, security, and performance.
    
- Often loaded dynamically to support modular hardware management.

---
### `Use Cases`

- Interfacing with storage devices (disks, SSDs)
    
- Managing input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, display)
    
- Enabling network communication (network cards, Wi-Fi adapters)
    
- Supporting specialized hardware (GPUs, sound cards, sensors)
    
- Allowing hardware upgrades without redesigning the OS
