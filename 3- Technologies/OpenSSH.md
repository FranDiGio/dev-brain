### `Definition`

**OpenSSH** is a **secure remote access and communication technology** that implements the SSH protocol to provide encrypted connections for remote login, command execution, file transfer, and tunneling.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Secure Remote Access**  
    Enables authenticated, encrypted connections to remote systems over untrusted networks.
    
- **Client–Server Architecture**  
    Includes both client tools (`ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`) and a server daemon (`sshd`).
    
- **Key-Based Authentication**  
    Supports public/private key authentication in addition to passwords.
    
- **Encrypted Communication**  
    All traffic is encrypted, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    
- **Port Forwarding & Tunneling**  
    Can securely forward ports and tunnel other protocols through SSH.
    
- **Foundational Infrastructure Tool**  
    Commonly used for server administration, automation, and secure file transfers.

### `Use Cases`

- Remote server administration
    
- Secure file transfer (SCP, SFTP)
    
- Infrastructure automation and CI/CD access
    
- Secure tunneling to internal services
    
- Accessing systems behind firewalls or NAT
