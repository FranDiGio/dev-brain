## `Definition`

Containers are a lightweight way to **package an application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit** that can run consistently across different environments. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host operating system’s kernel, which makes them more efficient and faster to start.

## `Key Ideas`

- **Portability** → Run the same container image on any machine (dev laptop, test server, cloud).
- **Developer-centric** → Simplifies setup by bundling dependencies; “works on my machine” problems are minimized.
- **Ecosystem enabler** → Foundation for modern DevOps practices, microservices, and cloud-native ecosystems (Kubernetes, Docker Hub, etc.).
- **Fast startup** → Launches in seconds due to lightweight isolation, unlike full virtual machines.
