### `Definition`

**Cloud IAM** (Identity and Access Management) is a **cloud-native technology** that manages user identities and access to cloud resources. It centralizes authentication, authorization, and role-based access control across cloud services like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Centralized Identity Control:**  
    Provides unified identity management across all cloud services.
    
- **Role- and Policy-Based Access:**  
    Defines fine-grained permissions using JSON policy documents (e.g., AWS IAM policies).
    
- **Federation and SSO Integration:**  
    Supports standards like **SAML** and **OpenID Connect** to integrate external identity providers.
    
- **Granular Resource Access:**  
    Permissions can target specific APIs, functions, or storage buckets.
    
- **Auditing & Compliance:**  
    Includes activity logging and compliance monitoring for governance.

### `Use Cases`

- Controlling developer and service access to cloud infrastructure.
    
- Integrating enterprise SSO and MFA into cloud environments.
    
- Enforcing least-privilege roles and resource-based policies.
    
- Automating user lifecycle management in multi-cloud setups.
