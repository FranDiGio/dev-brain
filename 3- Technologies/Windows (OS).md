    Includes PowerShell, Win32 API, .NET runtime, system services, package managers, and administrative tools.
    
- **Broad Device Support**  
    Compatible with a wide range of consumer and enterprise hardware.
    
- **Enterprise Integration**  
    Supports Active Directory, Group Policy, Windows Server roles, and enterprise authentication systems.
    
- **Edition Variants**  
    Distributed across desktop, server, workstation, and IoT/embedded editions.
    
- **Backward Compatibility**  
    Maintains strong support for legacy applications through Win32 APIs and compatibility layers.
