### `Definition`

**util-linux** is a **collection of essential low-level system utilities** that provide core functionality for managing disks, filesystems, users, sessions, and system state on Linux systems. It supplies tools that interact closely with the kernel and system hardware.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Low-Level System Utilities**  
    Includes commands such as `mount`, `umount`, `lsblk`, `blkid`, `fdisk`, `login`, `su`, `dmesg`, and `kill`.
    
- **Kernel-Facing User Space**  
    Many utilities directly interface with kernel subsystems like block devices, filesystems, and process management.
    
- **Foundational for System Operation**  
    Required for boot, login, storage management, and basic system administration.
    
- **Separate from GNU Coreutils**  
    Focuses on system-level tooling rather than file/text manipulation.
    
- **Widely Used Across Distributions**  
    Present on virtually all Linux distributions, regardless of package ecosystem.
