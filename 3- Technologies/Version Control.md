### `Definition`

**Version Control** is a **system for tracking changes** to files and coordinating work among multiple developers. It allows developers to manage revisions, merge changes, and restore previous states of a codebase.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Commit History:**  
    Records each change (commit) with metadata (author, timestamp, message) for traceability.
    
- **Branching and Merging:**  
    Enables isolated development through **branches**, later merging changes into the main codebase.
    
- **Collaboration:**  
    Allows multiple developers to contribute simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work.
    
- **Distributed vs. Centralized:**  
    Modern systems like **Git** are distributed — each developer has a full copy of the repository.  
    Older systems like **SVN** are centralized.

### `Use Cases`

- Managing source code across teams (Git, Mercurial, SVN)
- Open-source collaboration (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
- Experimentation through feature branches
- Rolling back to stable versions after failed releases
