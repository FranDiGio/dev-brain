### `Definition`

**Xcode Command Line Tools** are a **collection of developer-focused command-line utilities** provided by Apple to support software development on macOS. They supply essential tools such as compilers, build systems, debuggers, and version control utilities without requiring the full Xcode IDE.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Developer Toolchain**  
    Includes tools like `clang`, `make`, `lldb`, `git`, and related headers and SDK components.
    
- **Foundation for Development**  
    Required for compiling native code, building software, and installing many third-party tools.
    
- **Separate From Full Xcode**  
    Lightweight alternative to installing the complete Xcode application.
    
- **Integrated With macOS SDKs**  
    Provides access to system headers and frameworks needed to build macOS software.
    
- **System-Managed**  
    Installed and updated through Apple’s tooling, not a traditional package manager.
