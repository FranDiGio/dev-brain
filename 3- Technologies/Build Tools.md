### `Definition`

**Build tools** are programs that **automate the process of compiling, linking, packaging, and deploying software**. They handle repetitive tasks — from transforming source code into executable artifacts to running tests and managing dependencies.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Automation Backbone:**  
    Reduces manual effort by automating compile → test → package → deploy steps.
    
- **Dependency Resolution:**  
    Fetches required libraries and frameworks automatically.
    
- **Build Configuration:**  
    Build scripts define project structure, compilation rules, and environment-specific settings (e.g., `build.gradle`, `Makefile`).
    
- **Integration with CI/CD:**  
    Commonly used in automated pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
    
- **Common Tools:**
    
    - **Java:** Maven, Gradle
    - **JavaScript:** Webpack, Vite, Parcel
    - **C/C++:** Make, CMake
    - **Python:** setuptools, Poetry build commands
