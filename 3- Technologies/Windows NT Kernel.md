### `Definition`

The **Windows NT Kernel** is the **core system kernel** used by modern Windows operating systems, responsible for **process management, memory management, hardware abstraction, security, and system stability**.

It is the foundation of the **Windows NT family**, powering both desktop and server editions of Windows.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Hybrid Kernel Architecture**  
    Windows NT uses a **hybrid kernel design**, combining aspects of:
    
    - Microkernels (clear separation, modularity)
    - Monolithic kernels (performance-critical components in kernel mode)
    
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**  
    Includes a HAL that isolates the kernel from hardware specifics, allowing Windows to run across different CPU architectures and hardware platforms.
    
- **Preemptive Multitasking**  
    Supports fully preemptive scheduling, enabling responsive multitasking and efficient CPU time allocation between processes and threads.
    
- **Strong Security Model**  
    Built around:
    
    - User-mode vs kernel-mode separation
    - Access tokens and security identifiers (SIDs)
    - Mandatory access checks for system resources
    
- **Unified Kernel for Desktop & Server**  
    The same kernel architecture underpins:
    
    - Windows Desktop
    - Windows Server  
        ensuring consistency across consumer and enterprise environments.
    
- **Object-Based System Design**  
    Many kernel resources (processes, threads, files, devices) are managed as **objects** with standardized access and lifetime rules.
