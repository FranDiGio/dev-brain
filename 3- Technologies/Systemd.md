### `Definition`

**systemd** is a **system and service manager** for Linux that initializes the user space, manages system services, and coordinates system state during boot and runtime.

It replaces traditional init systems by providing a unified framework for service lifecycle management.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Acts as the **init system** (PID 1) on many Linux distributions.
    
- Manages **service startup, shutdown, and supervision**.
    
- Uses **unit files** to describe services, mounts, timers, sockets, and targets.
    
- Supports **parallel startup**, improving boot performance.
    
- Integrates closely with logging, device management, and session tracking.
    
- Centralizes many user-space system responsibilities under a single framework.

### `Use Cases`

- Bootstrapping the Linux user space
    
- Starting and supervising system services and daemons
    
- Managing dependencies between services
    
- Handling timers, scheduled tasks, and socket activation
    
- Coordinating system states such as multi-user or graphical modes
