### `Definition`

**Software-Defined Storage (SDS)** is a **storage technology** where **storage services are managed and delivered through software**, abstracted from the underlying hardware.

It enables flexible, scalable storage using **commodity hardware** rather than specialized storage appliances.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Hardware Abstraction**  
    SDS decouples storage logic from physical disks, allowing the same software layer to manage different hardware types.
    
- **Policy-Driven Management**  
    Storage behavior (replication, performance tiers, availability) is defined through software policies rather than hardware configuration.
    
- **Unified Storage Pooling**  
    Combines disks across multiple nodes into logical storage pools that can serve:
    
    - File storage
    - Block storage
    - Object storage
    
- **Horizontal Scalability**  
    Capacity and performance scale by **adding nodes**, not upgrading a single device.
    
- **Cloud & Distributed System Alignment**  
    SDS is a foundational technology for:
    
    - Cloud platforms
    - Hyper-converged infrastructure
    - Distributed storage systems

### `Use Cases`

- Cloud storage platforms (private or public)
    
- Hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI)
    
- Large-scale distributed systems
    
- Cost-efficient storage using commodity hardware
    
- Dynamic workloads requiring elastic storage capacity
