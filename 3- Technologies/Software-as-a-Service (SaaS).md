### `Definition`

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** is a **cloud service model** where fully developed applications are hosted and maintained by a provider, and delivered to users over the internet.

Customers access the software through a browser or app, while the provider manages everything — from infrastructure and updates to security and scaling.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Fully managed software:**  
    The provider handles the **infrastructure**, **platform**, and **application layer**, freeing users from setup, maintenance, or patching.
    
- **Subscription-based model:**  
    Users typically pay via a **monthly or annual subscription**, rather than owning software licenses.
    
- **Multi-tenancy:**  
    Multiple users or organizations share the same underlying infrastructure while keeping data logically isolated.
    
- **Scalability & accessibility:**  
    SaaS applications scale automatically with user demand and can be accessed anywhere via the web.
    
- **Security, compliance, and reliability:**  
    Managed by the vendor — ensuring uptime, backups, and updates — though it requires trust in the provider.
    
- **Customization limits:**  
    SaaS products offer configuration options but rarely deep customization, since all customers share the same codebase.
    
- **Common concerns:**
    
    - **Data ownership & privacy** → critical data resides on third-party infrastructure.
        
    - **Dependence on connectivity** → requires a stable internet connection.
        
    - **Vendor dependence** → service or pricing changes can affect business operations.
