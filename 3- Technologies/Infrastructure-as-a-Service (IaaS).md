### `Definition`

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** is a **cloud service model** that provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources — **servers, storage, and networking** — over the internet.  
It gives users the building blocks to create and manage their own virtualized environments without maintaining physical hardware.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Core services:**  
    - IaaS delivers **compute**, **storage**, and **networking** capabilities through a **pay-as-you-go** model.
    - Users can provision **virtual machines (VMs)** on top of a hypervisor layer and customize them for their workloads.
- **Scalability & elasticity:**  
    Automatically adjusts resources up or down based on demand, improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
    
- **Disaster recovery & high availability:**  
    Providers distribute workloads across multiple regions, minimizing downtime and data loss.
    
- **Developer enablement:**  
    Teams can quickly spin up isolated environments for development, testing, and staging — reducing setup friction.
    
- **Managed infrastructure:**  
    The provider maintains physical data centers, power, cooling, and hardware — while users manage their own operating systems, middleware, and applications.
    
- **Common concerns:**
    - **Dependency on provider uptime** (e.g., outages on AWS or Azure can affect all hosted services).
    - **Limited transparency** into the underlying physical resources.

### `Use Cases`

- Rapid provisioning of development or test environments.
    
- Hosting web applications or APIs on customizable virtual servers.
    
- Big data analytics and machine learning workloads requiring elastic compute power.
    
- Disaster recovery and backup infrastructure.
    
- Enterprise workload migration from on-premises to the cloud.
