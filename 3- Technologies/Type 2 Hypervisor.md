### `Definition`

A **Type 2 Hypervisor**, or **hosted hypervisor**, runs **on top of an existing operating system**.  
It uses the host OS to manage hardware access and provides a **user-friendly, flexible way** to run multiple virtual machines on personal or development systems.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Runs within a host OS** → The host operating system handles drivers, memory, and I/O operations.
    
- **Ease of use** → Simpler setup and configuration, ideal for testing and local development.
    
- **Higher latency** → Extra layer between VM and hardware causes reduced performance compared to Type 1.
    
- **Examples:** VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels Desktop.
    
- **Developer-focused** → Commonly used for learning, testing, and experimentation rather than production.

---
### `Use Cases`

- Local testing of multiple OS environments.
    
- Developer sandboxes for cross-platform work.
    
- Training, education, or software demos.
    
- Safe environments for malware analysis or system configuration experiments.
