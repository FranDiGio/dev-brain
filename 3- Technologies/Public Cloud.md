### `Definition`

A **Public Cloud** is a cloud computing model where resources such as servers, storage, and applications are **owned and managed by a third-party provider** and made available to multiple customers over the internet.

Users share the same infrastructure but remain logically isolated through permissions and virtual networks.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Shared Infrastructure** → Multiple tenants (customers) share physical resources while keeping their environments isolated.
    
- **Pay-as-you-go model** → You pay only for the computing, storage, or services you use.
    
- **Elastic scalability** → Instantly scale resources up or down depending on workload demands.
    
- **Managed services** → The provider handles hardware, networking, maintenance, and security updates.
    
- **Examples** → Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    
- **Trade-off** → Cost-efficient and fast to start, but limited control compared to private or on-premise setups.
