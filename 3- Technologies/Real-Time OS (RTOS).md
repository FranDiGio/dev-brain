### `Definition`

A **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** is an operating system designed to provide **deterministic and predictable timing behavior**, ensuring that tasks respond within **guaranteed time constraints**.

The primary goal of an RTOS is **meeting deadlines**, not maximizing throughput or user convenience.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Deterministic Scheduling**  
    Task execution is governed by predictable scheduling algorithms that guarantee **bounded response times**.
    
- **Priority-Based Task Management**  
    Tasks are typically scheduled based on fixed or dynamic priorities, allowing time-critical tasks to preempt others.
    
- **Low and Bounded Latency**  
    Interrupt handling, context switching, and system calls are designed to execute within known upper limits.
    
- **Deadline-Oriented Design**  
    System correctness depends not only on _what_ is computed, but **when** it is computed.
    
- **Minimal System Overhead**  
    RTOS kernels are usually lightweight, including only components required for real-time behavior.
    
- **Tight Hardware Interaction**  
    Often used in systems that interact directly with sensors, actuators, and control loops.
    
- **Not Necessarily Embedded (Conceptually)**  
    While commonly deployed in embedded systems, “real-time” refers to **timing guarantees**, not hardware size.
