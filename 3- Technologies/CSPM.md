### `Definition`

**Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)** is a category of security tools that **continuously assess cloud environments** to detect **misconfigurations, security risks, and compliance violations** across cloud resources.

CSPM tools help ensure cloud infrastructure is configured according to **security best practices and standards**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Continuous Configuration Assessment**  
    CSPM tools continuously scan cloud accounts, subscriptions, and projects for insecure settings.
    
- **Misconfiguration Detection**  
    Identifies common cloud risks such as:
    
    - Publicly exposed storage
    - Overly permissive network rules
    - Weak identity and access controls
    - Missing encryption or logging
    
- **Policy & Compliance Mapping**  
    Evaluates configurations against:
    
    - Provider best practices
    - Industry standards (CIS, ISO, SOC 2, etc.)
    - Internal organizational policies
    
- **Multi-Cloud Visibility**  
    Many CSPM platforms support multiple providers from a single control plane.
    
- **Alerting & Reporting**  
    Findings are surfaced through dashboards, alerts, and reports for security and engineering teams.
    
- **Optional Remediation**  
    Some CSPM tools can:
    
    - Recommend fixes
    - Auto-remediate issues
    - Integrate with CI/CD or ticketing systems

### `Use Cases`

- Improving overall cloud security posture
    
- Preventing breaches caused by misconfiguration
    
- Supporting compliance and audit readiness
    
- Gaining visibility across large or multi-cloud environments
    
- Enforcing security baselines at scale
