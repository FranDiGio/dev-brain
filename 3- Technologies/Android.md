### `Definition`

**Android** is a **mobile operating system platform** built on the Linux kernel that defines a complete **application model, runtime environment, security architecture, and device ecosystem** for mobile and connected devices.

It represents a **distinct OS platform**, not just a Linux distribution, due to its unique runtime, APIs, app lifecycle, and platform governance.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Platform-Level OS Architecture**  
    Android combines the Linux kernel with a custom user space, system services, application framework, and runtime, forming a unified OS platform.
    
- **Application-Centric Design**  
    The OS is structured around **applications as first-class citizens**, with managed lifecycles, sandboxing, and component-based execution.
    
- **Custom Runtime Environment**  
    Uses the **Android Runtime (ART)** instead of traditional Linux user-space execution models.
    
- **Strong Security & Isolation Model**  
    Enforces per-app sandboxing, permissions, and mandatory code signing at the OS level.
    
- **Hardware Abstraction via HAL**  
    Introduces a defined Hardware Abstraction Layer to support wide device and vendor diversity.
    
- **Open Core with Controlled Ecosystem**  
    Core OS is open-source (AOSP), while the mainstream ecosystem is governed through Google services, APIs, and distribution channels.
    
- **Multi-Device Expansion**  
    Extends beyond phones into tablets, wearables, TVs, automotive systems, and embedded devices.
