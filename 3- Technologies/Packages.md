### `Definition`

A **package** is a **bundled collection of files** — usually code, resources, and metadata — that can be distributed and reused across different projects. It represents a self-contained unit of functionality, typically versioned and shared through a registry or repository.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Reusable Distribution Unit:**  
    Packages make code modular and reusable, allowing developers to share libraries or features easily.
    
- **Metadata:**  
    Each package includes a descriptor (e.g., `package.json`, `setup.py`, `pom.xml`) defining its dependencies, version, and author info.
    
- **Versioning:**  
    Semantic versioning (e.g., `1.2.3`) ensures predictable upgrade paths and compatibility management.
    
- **Types of Packages:**
    
    - **Source Packages:** Contain human-readable code.
    - **Binary Packages:** Pre-compiled for faster installation.

### `Use Cases`

- Distributing reusable libraries and modules
- Managing shared dependencies across projects
- Versioning software releases for backward compatibility
- Publishing open-source projects to public registries
