### `Key Ideas`

- **OS-Critical Functionality**  
    System services enable fundamental Windows features including authentication, networking, device management, logging, and updates.
    
- **Managed by the OS**  
    These services are installed, configured, and maintained by Windows itself, not by end users or applications.
    
- **Early Startup & Persistence**  
    Many system services start during system boot and run continuously to ensure core functionality is always available.
    
- **Restricted Configuration**  
    Some system services have limited or protected configuration to prevent accidental system instability.
    
- **Security-Sensitive**  
    Often run under predefined service accounts with carefully scoped privileges.
    
- **Invisible to Users**  
    Typically operate without direct user interaction or UI.
