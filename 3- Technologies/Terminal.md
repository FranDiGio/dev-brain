### `Definition`

A **terminal** is a **user-space application** that provides a **text-based interface** for interacting with an operating system. It displays input and output for command execution and serves as the environment in which a **shell** runs.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Interface, Not a Shell**  
    The terminal is responsible for input/output display; command interpretation is handled by the shell running inside it.
    
- **User-Space Application**  
    Operates without elevated privileges and interacts with the OS indirectly through shells and system calls.
    
- **Cross-Platform Tooling**  
    Available on all major operating systems, with platform-specific implementations and feature sets.
    
- **Execution Environment**  
    Hosts shells, command-line tools, scripts, and development workflows.
    
- **Local and Remote Interaction**  
    Can be used to access both local systems and remote machines (e.g. via SSH).
