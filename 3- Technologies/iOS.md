### `Definition`

**iOS** is a **mobile operating system platform** developed by Apple for its mobile devices, defining a tightly integrated **OS architecture, application model, security framework, and hardware-software ecosystem**.

It represents a **closed, vertically integrated OS platform**, where hardware, operating system, APIs, and distribution are all controlled by Apple.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Vertically Integrated Platform**  
    iOS is designed alongside Apple hardware, enabling tight coordination between the OS, silicon, and device capabilities.
    
- **UNIX-Based Core (Darwin)**  
    Built on the Darwin OS, which includes the **XNU kernel**, combining Mach and BSD components.
    
- **App-Centric Execution Model**  
    Applications are sandboxed, lifecycle-managed, and event-driven, with strict background execution policies.
    
- **Strong Security & Privacy Model**  
    Enforces mandatory code signing, app sandboxing, secure boot, and fine-grained permission controls.
    
- **Curated Ecosystem Control**  
    App distribution, APIs, and system capabilities are governed through Apple’s App Store policies and developer programs.
    
- **Native Framework Stack**  
    Provides platform-specific frameworks (UIKit, SwiftUI, Core frameworks) tightly coupled to OS behavior.
    
- **Consistency Across Devices**  
    Prioritizes predictable behavior, performance, and UX consistency across supported devices.
