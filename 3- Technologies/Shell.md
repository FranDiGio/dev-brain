### `Definition`

A **shell** is a **user-space program** that provides a **command-line interface** for interacting with an operating system. It interprets user commands, launches programs, and enables scripting and automation.

Shells typically run **inside a terminal**, but can also operate in **non-interactive (scripted) mode**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Command-Line Interface Technology**  
    Acts as the primary tool for text-based interaction with the operating system.
    
- **Command Interpretation & Execution**  
    Reads user input, resolves commands, and executes programs or scripts.
    
- **Scripting Capability**  
    Provides a built-in scripting language supporting variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
    
- **Environment Management**  
    Manages environment variables, PATH resolution, aliases, and startup configuration.
    
- **Multiple Implementations**  
    Available across operating systems with different feature sets and philosophies:
    
    - Unix-like systems: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash
    - Windows: PowerShell, CMD
    - Cross-platform: Nushell
    
- **Interactive and Non-Interactive Use**  
    Supports both real-time command execution and batch/script execution.
