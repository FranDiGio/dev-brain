### `Definition`

A **Type 1 Hypervisor**, also known as a **bare-metal hypervisor**, runs **directly on the host’s hardware** without a host operating system. It manages hardware resources natively, offering **better performance, lower latency, and stronger isolation** than Type 2 hypervisors.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Direct hardware access** → Controls CPU, memory, and storage without going through an intermediary OS.
    
- **Enterprise-grade performance** → Commonly used in data centers and cloud platforms for efficient multi-VM management.
    
- **Higher security** → Smaller attack surface since there’s no general-purpose OS underneath.
    
- **Examples:** VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V (Core), KVM, Xen.
    
- **Foundation for IaaS** → Cloud providers rely on Type 1 hypervisors to host virtual servers at scale.

---
### `Use Cases`

- Enterprise virtualization in data centers.
    
- Cloud computing environments (AWS, Azure, GCP).
    
- High-performance workloads requiring low latency and strong isolation.
    
- Hosting virtual desktops or containerized environments at scale.
