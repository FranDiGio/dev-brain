### `Key Ideas`

- **Data Storage & Retrieval:**  
    Enables structured access to data using queries, APIs, or commands.
    
- **Abstraction Layer:**  
    Applications interact with the DBMS instead of dealing with raw files.
    
- **Data Integrity & Constraints:**  
    Enforces rules such as primary keys, uniqueness, relationships, and validation.
    
- **Concurrency Control:**  
    Handles multiple users accessing or modifying data at the same time.
    
- **Security & Access Control:**  
    Supports authentication, authorization, and auditing.
    
- **Backup & Recovery:**  
    Ensures data safety through snapshots, logs, and replication mechanisms.
    
- **Types of DBMS:**
    
    - Relational (SQL) — tables, schemas
        
    - NoSQL — documents, key-value, graphs
        
    - In-memory — extremely fast, RAM-based
        
    - Distributed — horizontally scalable
