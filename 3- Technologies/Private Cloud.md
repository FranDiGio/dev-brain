### `Definition`

A **Private Cloud** is a cloud computing model where the **infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization**. Unlike the Public Cloud, resources are **not shared** with other tenants and can be hosted either **on-premises** or by a third-party provider in an isolated environment.

It offers the scalability and automation of the cloud but with greater **control, security, and customization**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Single-tenant infrastructure** → All resources are reserved for one organization.
    
- **Greater control** → Full visibility into data management, hardware, and network configurations.
    
- **Enhanced security & compliance** → Ideal for industries with strict data governance (e.g., healthcare, finance).
    
- **Flexible hosting** → Can be deployed on-premises, in a dedicated data center, or by a managed cloud provider.
    
- **Trade-off** → More control and security come at higher cost and management complexity compared to public clouds.

*When you go private, you have two typical payment models:*

|Model|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Dedicated infrastructure**|You rent a fixed pool of servers — whether you use 2 or 4, you pay for all 4 because they’re exclusively yours.|AWS Dedicated Hosts, Google Bare Metal, IBM Cloud Dedicated|
|**Virtual private cloud (VPC)**|You’re on shared physical hardware but logically isolated; you pay only for the resources (CPU/RAM/storage) you actually allocate.|AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network|
