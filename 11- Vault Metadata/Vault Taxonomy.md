| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1- Concepts**                | **Timeless ideas, principles, and mental models** that explain _what something is_ and _why it exists_, independent of implementation.        | Abstraction, DevOps Culture, Infrastructure, Conway’s Law               |
| **2- Mechanisms**              | **Operational abstractions** that explain _how systems achieve behavior_. Not tools, not products, but reusable ways systems work internally. | Processes, System Calls, Memory Management, Control Flow, Load Balancer |
| **3- Methodologies**           | **Structured approaches and processes** for organizing work, teams, or development over time.                                                 | Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, TDD                                    |
| **4- Technologies**            | **Concrete technical platforms, systems, or tool categories** that you choose to build on.                                                    | Android, Linux, Containers, Databases, Frameworks                       |
| **5- Implementations**         | **Specific, real-world instances or versions** of a technology.                                                                               | Ubuntu, Windows 11, Docker Engine, React 18                             |
| **6- Deliverables**            | **Tangible artifacts** produced during engineering or organizational processes.                                                               | SRS, User Stories, Diagrams, Design Documents                           |
| **7- Practices**               | **Guiding rules, habits, or principles** that shape how work is done, often cutting across tools and methodologies.                           | SOLID, Least Privilege, Code Review, Pair Programming                   |
| **8- Domains**                 | **Broad areas of expertise or responsibility** that group related concepts, mechanisms, and technologies.                                     | Software Engineering, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity                    |

| **10- References & Standards** | **Authoritative specifications, protocols, and formal references** that define interoperability and contracts.                                | HTTP, POSIX, OAuth 2.0, OSI Model                                       |
| **11- Templates**              | **Reusable note structures** that standardize how information is captured in the vault.                                                       | Concept Template, Mechanism Template                                    |
| **12- Vault Metadata**         | **Meta-notes about the vault itself**: structure, rules, evolution, and maintenance.                                                          | Vault Structure, Vault Taxonomy                                         |
