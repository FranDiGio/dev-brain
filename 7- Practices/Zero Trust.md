### `Definition`

**Zero Trust** is a **security model** that assumes no implicit trust — every access request must be **continuously verified**, regardless of user, device, or network location.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Never Trust, Always Verify:**  
    Every connection is authenticated and authorized dynamically.
    
- **Context-Aware Access:**  
    Evaluates identity, device health, location, and behavior in real time.
    
- **Micro-Segmentation:**  
    Restricts lateral movement within networks and cloud environments.
    
- **Integration with IAM:**  
    Relies heavily on strong IAM policies, MFA, and least-privilege enforcement.

---
### `Challenges`

- **Implementation Complexity:**  
    Integrating continuous verification across legacy systems and multiple environments can be resource-intensive.
    
- **User Experience Friction:**  
    Frequent authentication or device checks may frustrate end-users if poorly configured.
    
- **Visibility and Monitoring Gaps:**  
    Achieving full context awareness requires complete, accurate telemetry from all devices and networks.
    
- **Cultural and Process Resistance:**  
    Teams accustomed to perimeter-based security often struggle to adapt to Zero Trust’s constant verification mindset.
