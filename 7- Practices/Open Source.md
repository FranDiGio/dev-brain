### `Definition`

**Open source** is the practice of **making source code publicly accessible** so others can study it, use it, modify it, and distribute improvements, enabling collaborative and transparent software development.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **Shared Codebase**  
    Source code is available to anyone, not restricted to a single organization.
    
- **Collaborative Development**  
    Contributions come from individuals, teams, or organizations across the world.
    
- **Peer Review & Transparency**  
    Bugs, security issues, and design decisions are visible and reviewable.
    
- **Community Governance**  
    Projects often rely on maintainers, contribution guidelines, and community norms.
    
- **License-Driven Rules**  
    Usage, modification, and redistribution are governed by open-source licenses.
    
- **Common Across Domains**  
    Widely used in operating systems, infrastructure, frameworks, tooling, and libraries.

### `Challenges`

- **Maintenance Burden**  
    Popular projects may depend on a small number of unpaid maintainers.
    
- **Quality Varies**  
    Open availability does not guarantee good design or documentation.
    
- **Sustainability Issues**  
    Funding and long-term support can be unclear.
    
- **Misconception of “Free”**  
    Open source does not always mean free of cost, risk, or responsibility.
    
- **Contribution Barriers**  
    Large or complex codebases can be difficult for newcomers to contribute to.
