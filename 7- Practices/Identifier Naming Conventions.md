### `Definition`

**Identifier naming conventions** are the practice of using **consistent, meaningful naming patterns** for variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers to improve code readability, clarity, and maintainability.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Consistency over Preference**  
    Following a shared convention matters more than which convention is chosen.
    
- **Communicates Intent**  
    Good names explain _what_ something represents or does without extra comments.
    
- **Common Styles**
    
    - `camelCase` → variables, functions (many languages)
    - `PascalCase` → classes, types
    - `snake_case` → variables, functions (Python, C)
    - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` → constants
    
- **Scope-Aware Naming**  
    Broader scope → more descriptive names  
    Narrow scope → shorter, focused names
    
- **Avoids Ambiguity**  
    Prevents confusion between similar concepts and reduces cognitive load.
    
- **Language & Community Driven**  
    Conventions often follow language norms or project standards rather than personal taste.

### `Challenges`

- **Subjectivity**  
    Naming quality is hard to measure and often debated.
    
- **Over-verbosity**  
    Names that are too long can become noisy and reduce readability.
    
- **Inconsistent Codebases**  
    Mixing conventions makes code harder to scan and reason about.
    
- **Renaming Cost**  
    Poor early naming can spread and become expensive to refactor.
    
- **False Sense of Clarity**  
    A well-named identifier cannot compensate for bad design.
