### `Definition`

**Pair programming** is a collaborative development practice where **two programmers work together at one workstation**, sharing a single codebase in real time.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Workflow**:
	- The **Driver** focuses on implementing code — typing, managing syntax, and solving immediate problems.
	    
	- The **Navigator** watches from a higher level — reviewing logic, anticipating issues, suggesting improvements, and thinking ahead strategically.
		
	- They switch roles frequently to balance workload and ensure shared understanding.
	
- **Importance**:
	- It’s especially effective in complex or high-stakes sections of code, onboarding new developers, or teaching unfamiliar technologies.
		
	- It contributes to **social coding** and **DevOps culture** by breaking isolation, encouraging openness, and creating a shared sense of responsibility.
		
	- It improves **code quality**, **team communication**, and **collective ownership**.

### `Challenges`

- Can be **inefficient** if pairs aren’t balanced in skill or communication style.
	
- **Fatigue** or conflict can arise if sessions go too long without breaks.
	
- May feel **slower** at first — but the long-term quality gains often outweigh the initial time cost.
