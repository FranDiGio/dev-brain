## `Definition`

**DevOps** (short for _Development and Operations_) is a cultural and technical movement that extends Agile principles to the entire software delivery lifecycle. Its goal is to **unify development and operations** through collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, enabling faster and more reliable delivery of value to users.

---
## `Key Ideas`

- **Breaking silos** → Dev and Ops working together instead of separately.
- **Fail fast, recover fast** → embrace experimentation with quick rollback strategies.
- **Continuous feedback** → testing in real environments (e.g., A/B testing) rather than relying only on analysis.
- **Culture first** → tools support DevOps, but real success comes from openness, trust, and communication.
- **Automation** → infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring at scale.

---
## `Requires`

- A cultural shift in mindset and collaboration.
- Modern application design that supports iteration and resilience.
- Leveraging automation across build, test, deploy, and monitoring.
- A programmable platform enabling **continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)**.
