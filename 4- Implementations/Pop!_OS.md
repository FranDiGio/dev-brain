### `Key Capabilities`

- **COSMIC Desktop Environment**  
    A customized GNOME-based interface (moving toward a Rust-based DE) with:
    
    - Automatic tiling
    - Workspaces-centric workflow
    - Keyboard-driven navigation
    - Clean and minimal UI
    
- **Developer & Power-User Focus**  
    Pop!_OS includes:
    
    - Preinstalled coding tools
    - GPU drivers (NVIDIA ISO available)
    - System-wide dark mode
    - Productivity improvements like better window management
    
- **Excellent NVIDIA Support**  
    Offers **separate NVIDIA builds** ensuring out-of-the-box GPU functionality—rare among Linux distros.
    
- **Strong Hardware Compatibility**  
    Optimized for System76 hardware but works well on most laptops and desktops.
    
- **Ubuntu Base**  
    Uses APT for package management and benefits from Ubuntu's massive software repositories.
    
- **Hybrid Graphics Support**  
    Built-in GPU switching for laptops with integrated + dedicated GPUs.

### `Challenges`

- **Not purely upstream GNOME**  
    Pop's modified GNOME sometimes lags behind GNOME feature changes.
    
- **Less community size than Ubuntu or Fedora**  
    Smaller documentation and troubleshooting ecosystem.
    
- **Frequent changes in COSMIC direction**  
    Transitioning from GNOME to a full Rust-based DE may cause occasional breakage or unstable transitions.
    
- **More resource-heavy than lightweight distros**  
    Due to animation-heavy UI and tiling features.
