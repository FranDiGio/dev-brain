---
### `Challenges`

- **Snap performance issues**  
    Snap apps may load slower and consume more disk space.
    
- **Heavier Desktop Environment**  
    GNOME uses more RAM compared to lightweight desktops (XFCE, LXQt).
    
- **Not bleeding-edge**  
    Ubuntu prioritizes stability; versions may lag behind rolling distros (Arch, Fedora Rawhide).
    
- **Licensing restrictions**  
    Some proprietary codecs/drivers require additional setup.
