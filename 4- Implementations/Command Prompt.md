### `Definition`

**Command Prompt (cmd.exe)** is a **text-based command-line shell** for Windows that allows users to execute system commands, run batch scripts, and interact with the operating system at a basic level.

It is primarily used for **legacy compatibility**, simple automation, and basic system interaction.

---
### `Key Capabilities`

- **Command execution**  
    Runs built-in commands and external executables.
    
- **Batch scripting support**  
    Supports `.bat` and `.cmd` files for simple automation.
    
- **Low overhead and fast startup**  
    Lightweight compared to modern shells.
    
- **Deep Windows compatibility**  
    Works reliably with older tools and scripts that expect cmd behavior.
    
- **Environment variable handling**  
    Allows basic environment configuration and parameter passing.

---
### `Usage Basics`

- Launch the shell:
    
    - `cmd`
    
- Run a command:
    
    - `dir`
    
- Change directory:
    
    - `cd path`

---
### `Challenges`

- **Text-only pipeline** (no object passing)
    
- **Limited scripting capabilities** compared to PowerShell
    
- **Poor composability** for complex automation
    
- **Legacy quirks** and inconsistent syntax
