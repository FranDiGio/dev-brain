### `Definition`

**OpenBSD** is a **free and open-source Unix-like operating system** from the **BSD family**, known for its **security-first philosophy, code correctness, and simplicity**.

It is designed to be **secure by default**, with a strong emphasis on **proactive security and clean system design**.

### `Key Capabilities`

- **Security-First Design**  
    Security is a core goal, not an add-on, including:
    
    - Proactive code auditing
    - Secure defaults
    - Minimal attack surface
    
- **Integrated BSD System**  
    Developed as a **complete operating system**, where:
    
    - Kernel
    - Userland
    - Networking tools  
        are tightly integrated and maintained together.
    
- **Advanced Security Features**  
    Includes:
    
    - `pledge` (restrict process capabilities)
    - `unveil` (filesystem access control)
    - Strong privilege separation
    
- **High-Quality Networking Stack**  
    Known for:
    
    - Clean and correct TCP/IP implementation
    - `pf` firewall (widely adopted elsewhere)
    
- **Cryptography Leadership**  
    Maintains and contributes to widely used security tools and libraries, including:
    
    - OpenSSH
    - LibreSSL
    
- **Simplicity Over Features**  
    Favors:
    
    - Readable code
    - Predictable behavior  
        over rapid feature expansion.

---
### `Usage Basics`

- Default installation is **minimal and secure**
    
- Configuration via simple text files in `/etc`
    
- Package management via:
    - `pkg_add`, `pkg_delete`, `pkg_info`

---
### `Challenges`

- **Performance Is Not the Primary Goal**  
    Security and correctness take precedence over raw speed.
    
- **Smaller Package Ecosystem**  
    Compared to Linux and FreeBSD.
    
- **Limited Hardware Support**  
    Focuses on well-supported, well-tested hardware.
    
- **Not Desktop-Focused**  
    Best suited for:
    
    - Firewalls
    - Security appliances
    - Servers
