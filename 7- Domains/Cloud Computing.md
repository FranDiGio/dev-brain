### `Definition`

**Cloud Computing** is the **domain** of technology focused on delivering computing services — including servers, storage, databases, networking, and software — **over the internet**.

It replaces local infrastructure ownership with **on-demand, scalable, and managed resources** provided by cloud vendors.

---
### `Key Areas`

- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Virtualized hardware and resource orchestration that underpin cloud environments.
    
- **Cloud Service Models:** Abstraction layers defining provider vs. user responsibility — _IaaS, PaaS, SaaS_.
    
- **Cloud Deployment Models:** Configurations based on ownership and accessibility — _Public, Private, Hybrid, Multi-cloud_.
    
- **Cloud Storage:** Data storage systems such as _Block, File, and Object_ storage.
    
- **Serverless Computing:** Event-driven execution of code without provisioning or managing servers.
    
- **Cloud Networking:** Virtualized network infrastructure enabling secure, scalable interconnectivity.
    
- **Cloud Security:** Measures and frameworks protecting cloud systems, data, and identities.
