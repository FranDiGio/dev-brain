### `Definition`

**Software Testing** is a **domain within software engineering** focused on ensuring that software products meet their **functional and non-functional requirements** through structured verification and validation activities.  

Its goal is to deliver **reliable, secure, and high-quality software** by detecting defects early and continuously improving system performance.

### `Key Areas`

- **Functional Testing** – Verifies that software functions align with specified requirements (e.g., unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing).
    
- **Non-Functional Testing** – Evaluates system qualities like **performance**, **scalability**, **usability**, **availability**, and **security**.
    
- **Regression Testing** – Confirms that code updates or bug fixes haven’t broken existing functionality.
    
- **Test Automation** – Uses tools and frameworks to execute tests efficiently and repeatedly across builds.
    
- **Test Case Design & Management** – Defines, organizes, and maintains testing scenarios, data, and expected outcomes.
    
- **Quality Assurance (QA)** – Broader discipline that encompasses testing, standards, and continuous process improvement.
    
- **Continuous Testing** – Integration of automated testing into CI/CD pipelines to ensure constant feedback during development.
