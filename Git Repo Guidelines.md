## `Explanation`

- Only one master branch and other branches are created per feature or fix as necessary. Delete after all work is done and merged.
- One repo per microservice/component, you don't want multiple microservices in one repo.
- Make other people merge your Pull Requests, to have 2 sets of eyes for all code that goes into the repo.
