### `Definition`

A reference for **Bash built-in commands** — commands that are **implemented directly by the Bash shell**, not executed as external programs.

These commands cease to exist if Bash is removed.

---
### `Purpose`

To provide a **clear, shell-specific reference** for commands that are **handled internally by Bash**, helping distinguish them from Linux utilities and avoid confusion when switching shells or writing scripts.

- `cd <dir>` — change current working directory
    
- `pwd` — print current working directory

- `printf <fmt>` — formatted output
    
- `type <cmd>` — show how a command is resolved
    
- `history` — display command history
    
- `exit` — exit the current shell
    
- `exec <cmd>` — replace shell process with command

##### ==`Input & I/O Built-ins`==

- `read VAR` — read a line from stdin into a variable  
	
- `read -p "Prompt: " VAR` — prompt before reading input  
	
- `read -r VAR` — read raw input (disable backslash escaping)

##### ==`Environment & Context`==

- `export VAR=value` — export variable to child processes
    
- `set` — set shell options or list variables
    
- `unset VAR` — remove variable or function
    
- `umask` — show or set default file permission mask

##### ==`Aliases & Sourcing`==

- `alias name='cmd'` — define alias
    
- `unalias name` — remove alias
    
- `source <file>` / `. <file>` — execute file in current shell

##### ==`Job Control`==
