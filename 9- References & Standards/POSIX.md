### `Definition`

**POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)** is a **set of IEEE standards** that defines a **common operating system interface** for Unix-like systems, specifying expected behavior for **processes, files, permissions, signals, and system calls**.

---
### `Purpose`

POSIX exists to enable **portable software** by ensuring that programs can rely on a **consistent operating system behavior** across different Unix-like implementations, regardless of the underlying kernel or distribution.

It reduces fragmentation by establishing a **shared contract** between applications and the operating system.

---
### `Structure`

POSIX is structured as a collection of specifications covering:

- **System interfaces (APIs)**  
    Standardized OS-level functions for process control, file I/O, and execution.
    
- **Filesystem and permissions model**  
    Files, directories, ownership, and access control semantics.
    
- **Process and execution model**  
    Process creation, signals, environment variables, and lifecycle behavior.
    
- **Utilities and environment definitions**  
    Required OS-provided utilities and execution environment expectations.
