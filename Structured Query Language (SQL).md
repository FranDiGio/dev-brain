### `Definition`

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a **standardized programming language** used to **manage, manipulate, and query relational databases**.  
It provides a structured way to define, read, modify, and control access to data stored in **tables**.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Relational Model:**  
    SQL operates on databases structured into **tables**, which consist of **rows (records)** and **columns (fields)**.  
    Relationships between tables are defined through **keys** (primary, foreign).
    
- **Declarative Syntax:**  
    SQL focuses on **what** data is needed, not **how** to retrieve it — the database engine handles optimization and execution.
    
- **Main Language Components:**
    
    - **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Defines and modifies structures (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).
        
    - **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Handles data itself (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
        
    - **DCL (Data Control Language):** Manages permissions and access control (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`).
        
    - **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Handles transactions (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`).
    
- **Query Operations (CRUD):**  
    SQL is used to **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** data — fundamental to database interactions.
    
- **Joins and Relationships:**  
    Allows combining data from multiple tables via **INNER**, **LEFT**, **RIGHT**, and **FULL** joins.
    
- **Extensions and Dialects:**  
    While SQL is standardized (ANSI SQL), popular implementations like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQL Server**, and **Oracle SQL** include dialect-specific features.

### `Use Cases`

- Querying large datasets efficiently.
- Designing relational database schemas.
- Creating reports and dashboards.
- Building data-driven backend applications.
- Managing access control and transactional integrity.
