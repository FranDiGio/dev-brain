### `dev-brain`

A structured knowledge system for software engineering.

**dev-brain** captures how I understand systems, from first principles to real-world implementation.  
It separates ideas from tools, mechanisms from products, and theory from execution.

### `Structure`

The vault is organized into conceptual layers:

- **Concepts** → What something is / why it exists  
- **Mechanisms** → How behavior happens  
- **Technologies** → Categories of platforms  
- **Implementations** → Specific products or versions  

Supporting layers:

- **Methodologies** – How work is organized  
- **Practices** – How engineers behave  
- **Deliverables** – What gets produced  
- **Domains / Languages / Standards** – Classification layers  
- **Cheatsheets** – Quick reference  
- **Templates / Metadata** – Vault scaffolding  

Notes link across layers intentionally.

### `Goal`

- Build structural understanding instead of fragmented notes. 
- This system evolves with projects, work experience, and continuous learning.
