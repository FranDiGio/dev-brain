### `Definition`

**Quality Assurance (QA)** is a **discipline within software engineering** that ensures software products are developed and delivered according to defined **quality standards** and **process best practices**.

It focuses on **preventing defects** through process control, continuous improvement, and adherence to standards across the entire **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.

### `Key Areas`

- **Software Testing:**  
    Validates that software behaves as expected and meets both functional and non-functional requirements. Includes unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
    
- **Process Quality Management:**  
    Defines and enforces workflows, coding standards, and documentation practices to maintain consistency and reliability in development.
    
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
    Uses metrics, retrospectives, and feedback loops to enhance the development process and prevent recurring issues.
    
- **Automation & CI/CD Integration:**  
    Embeds testing and validation within automated pipelines to ensure rapid, reliable deployments.
    
- **Code Reviews & Peer Verification:**  
    Detects potential issues early through collaborative evaluation of source code.
    
- **Metrics & Reporting:**  
    Tracks defect rates, test coverage, velocity, and release stability to measure quality trends and performance.
