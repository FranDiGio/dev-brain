### `Definition`

**Cybersecurity** is the domain focused on **protecting digital systems, networks, and data** from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage.

It encompasses the strategies, processes, and technologies that ensure the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of information across on-premise, hybrid, and cloud environments.

### `Key Areas`

- **Information Security** – Safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure or modification.
    
- **Network Security** – Protecting network infrastructure and traffic from intrusions, misuse, and disruptions.
    
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** – Controlling and verifying who can access systems and data.
    
- **Data Security** – Ensuring data protection through encryption, governance, and loss prevention techniques.
    
- **Threats and Vulnerabilities** – Understanding and mitigating risks like DDoS, insider threats, and data breaches.
    
- **Security Frameworks** – Standardized models and best practices (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework).
    
- **Cloud Security** – Securing data, applications, and services hosted in cloud environments.
