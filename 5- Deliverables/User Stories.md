### `Definition`

A **User Story** is a **short, simple description of a feature or requirement** written from the perspective of the end user. It captures _who_ needs something, _what_ they need, and _why_ — emphasizing **business value** rather than technical detail.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Format:**
    
    > _As a [role], I want [goal or feature], so that [reason or business value]._  
    > Example: _As a marketing manager, I want a list of customer emails so that I can send promotions._
    
- **Purpose:**  
    Breaks complex requirements into small, deliverable units that can be completed within one sprint.
    
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    Defines the conditions under which the story is considered “done.”  
    Often written using the _Given–When–Then_ format (from Gherkin syntax).  
    Example:
    
    > _Given_ 100 customers exist, _when_ I request the email list, _then_ I should see only those opted into promotions.*
    
- **The INVEST Criteria (good story checklist):**
    
    - **I**ndependent – can be prioritized and delivered separately.
        
    - **N**egotiable – open to refinement and discussion.
        
    - **V**aluable – delivers measurable business value.
        
    - **E**stimable – can be sized for effort.
        
    - **S**mall – fits within one sprint.
        
    - **T**estable – has clear acceptance criteria.
    
- **Refinement:**  
    Stories are refined, split, or reprioritized during **backlog grooming**.  
    Large stories become **Epics** until broken down further.
