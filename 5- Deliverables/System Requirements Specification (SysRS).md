### `Definition`

A **System Requirements Specification (SysRS)** defines the **complete set of requirements for an entire system**, including both **software and hardware components**. It provides a higher-level view than the SRS, ensuring that all interacting parts of the system — software, hardware, interfaces, and users — work together effectively.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Purpose:**  
    Describes the **capabilities, constraints, and interactions** of the entire system environment.  
    Ensures that all technical, operational, and regulatory requirements are addressed before design and implementation.
    
- **Scope:**  
    Broader than an **SRS** — the SysRS may include:
    
    - **System capabilities and architecture**
        
    - **Interfaces** between software, hardware, and external systems
        
    - **Performance, reliability, and security requirements**
        
    - **Compliance and policy requirements**
        
    - **Personnel and operational requirements** (e.g., training, support)
        
    - **Acceptance criteria** for the overall system
    
- **Use:**  
    Commonly used in large or complex projects where multiple subsystems or technologies must integrate.  
    It guides both software and hardware development teams, ensuring interoperability and alignment with system-level goals.
    
- **Relationship to Other Docs:**  
    The SysRS often informs or contains multiple **SRS documents** for individual software components.  
    It aligns system-level design decisions with the **business and technical requirements** defined earlier in the SDLC.
