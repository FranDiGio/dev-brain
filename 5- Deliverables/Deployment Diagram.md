### `Definition`

A **Deployment Diagram** is a visual representation of how an application’s software components are deployed across infrastructure resources such as servers, containers, networks, and cloud services. It shows **where** the system runs and **how** hardware, networking, and runtime environments are organized.

### `Key Ideas`

- **Maps Software to Infrastructure:**  
    Illustrates how services, components, and databases are hosted on physical or virtual nodes.
    
- **Shows Runtime Topology:**  
    Represents servers, VMs, containers, clusters, and their communication paths.
    
- **Clarifies Environment Boundaries:**  
    Highlights network segments, firewalls, load balancers, and DMZ zones when relevant.
    
- **Supports Deployment Planning:**  
    Helps teams understand scaling, redundancy, and high availability setups.
    
- **Cloud + On-Prem Friendly:**  
    Can describe cloud-native deployments, hybrid setups, or traditional on-prem environments.
    
- **Used During Design + Ops:**  
    Created during design but used heavily in DevOps, security reviews, and production planning.
