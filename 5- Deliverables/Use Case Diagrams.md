### `Definition`

A **Use Case Diagram** is a **visual representation of system functionality from the user’s perspective**, showing **actors** and the **use cases (actions)** they can perform within a system. It focuses on **what the system does**, not how it is implemented.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- **User-Centric View**  
    Models system behavior in terms of **user goals**, rather than internal logic or architecture.
    
- **Actors and Use Cases**  
    Includes:
    
    - **Actors** (users or external systems)
    - **Use cases** (functional capabilities)
    
- **System Boundary**  
    Clearly defines what is **inside** and **outside** the system’s scope.
    
- **High-Level Functional Scope**  
    Captures:
    
    - Core system capabilities
    - Interactions with external entities  
        without technical detail.
    
- **Communication Tool**  
    Commonly used to:
    
    - Align stakeholders
    - Clarify requirements
    - Establish functional scope early in design
    
- **UML-Based Diagram**  
    Use Case Diagrams are part of **UML**, but can be used informally as well.
