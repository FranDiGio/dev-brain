### `Definition`

A **Burndown Chart** is a **visual progress-tracking tool** used in Agile (especially Scrum) to show how much work remains versus time left in a sprint or project. It helps teams see whether they are on track to complete all committed user stories within the iteration.

### `Key Ideas`

- **X-Axis (Time):** Represents the sprint duration (e.g., 1–4 weeks).
    
- **Y-Axis (Work Remaining):** Measured in story points, tasks, or hours.
    
- **Ideal Line:** A straight diagonal showing perfect progress if work were completed evenly over time.
    
- **Actual Line:** Plots real progress as tasks are completed daily; deviations highlight over/under-performance.
    
- **Use:** Reviewed in daily standups or retrospectives to identify trends, bottlenecks, or unrealistic sprint commitments.
	
- **Gray blocks:** It shows the weekends as you don't want to burnout your team.
