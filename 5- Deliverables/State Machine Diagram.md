### `Definition`

State machine diagrams model how an object or system transitions between different states in response to events. They show the lifecycle of an entity and the rules that govern its behavior.

---
### `Key Ideas`

- Represent states, transitions, events, and actions.
    
- Show how an object behaves over time.
    
- Useful for modeling complex, state-driven logic (e.g., UI screens, authentication flow, device modes).
    
- Capture valid and invalid transitions, ensuring predictable behavior.
    
- Common in systems with well-defined processes or workflows.
